JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API in Java that enables applications to connect to and interact with databases. It provides a standardized way for Java programs to execute SQL queries, retrieve and update data, and manage database connections, making it an essential tool for any Java developer working with databases.

How to use JDBC?

For that, we have 7 levels:

1. We need to import specific package.

2. We need to load and register to JDBC Driver

3. We should establish the connection 

4. We should create the statement 

5. Execute the query 

6. Process the result

7. Close recources

What is Driver?

A JDBC driver is a set of classes and interfaces that allow Java applications to interact with databases. It acts as a translator between Java applications and the specific database, enabling communication between the two.
