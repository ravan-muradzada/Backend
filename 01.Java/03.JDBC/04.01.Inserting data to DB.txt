Another main thing we can do with databases is inserting values to its tables. We can do it using Java language.

The steps for inserting process are the similar to fetching.



1. We need to import the package (java.sql.*).



2. We need to load and register using the same instruction. (com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver)



3. Moreover, we create a connection like in fetching, using Connection interface and getConnection(...) method.



4. The next step is creating a statement. This part is a little bit different.
So here we use PreparedStatement interface and prepareStatement(query) of Connection interface.

To write query, we use ? marks instead of the values, such as:

String query = "INSERT INTO students VALUES (?,?)";  

It is like format specifier and we put the specific value to them after creating PreparedStatement object.
We use setInt() for intergers, setString() for Strings here.
Its syntax is like that:

pst.setInt(1, newUser_id); // For the first ?
pst.setString(2, newUser_name); // For the second ?

Here the first argument shows the place of ?. If we want to specify value for the first ?, we use 1.



5. Now we should execute the statement, for that we use executeUpdate() method of PreparedStatement interface.



6. The query inserts the values we mentioned and then returns us the number of row/s affected. We can keep its value in the int variable:

int countOfRowsAffected = pst.executeUpdate();
[We also use .executeUpdate() when we need to delete any row from the table.]


7. After all we should close Connection and PreparedStatement objects:

con.close();
pst.close();

----------------------------------------------------

I have created an example code for inserting values to db table.
In this example table, there are two columns:

id INT,
name VARCHAR(20).
