The forName() method in Java is used to dynamically load a class at runtime. It is a static method of the Class class and plays a critical role in Java's reflection mechanism and other functionalities like loading database drivers.

And it is known that when a class is loaded in Java, its static initializier automatically works, so loading a java class means to use its static initializier (without creating an object of it, because another method to load a class is creating its object).
