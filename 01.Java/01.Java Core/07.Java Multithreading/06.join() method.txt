The join() method in Java is used to pause the execution of the current thread until the thread on which join() was called has finished its execution. This method is part of the Thread class and is commonly used to ensure that a thread completes its task before the program or other threads proceed.

Purpose of the join() Method:

The primary purpose of the join() method is to synchronize the execution of threads. It ensures that one thread waits for another thread to finish before continuing its execution. This is useful when you have tasks that depend on the completion of other tasks or threads.

How join() Works:

-When a thread calls join() on another thread, the calling thread is blocked until the thread on which join() was called completes (reaches its run() methodâ€™s end).
-Once the thread finishes, the blocked thread can resume its execution.

Why Use join()?

Ensuring Order of Execution: If you want one thread to wait for another to finish before continuing, join() is useful.
For example, if you are performing some computation in one thread and you need the result in another thread, you can use join() to make sure the computation thread finishes before proceeding with the dependent thread.
