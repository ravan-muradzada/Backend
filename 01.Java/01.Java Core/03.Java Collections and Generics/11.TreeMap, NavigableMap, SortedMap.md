1. TreeMap in Java: Overview

A TreeMap is part of Javaâ€™s java.util package and implements the NavigableMap interface. It stores key-value pairs in a sorted order, where keys are stored in ascending order by default. Internally, TreeMap is implemented using a Red-Black binary tree, which ensures that the map remains balanced for efficient access and operations.


2. SortedMap Interface

The SortedMap interface is a subinterface of Map that orders its keys. It provides operations to:

Retrieve the first and last keys (firstKey(), lastKey()).
Get a portion of the map (subMap(), headMap(), tailMap()).
A TreeMap implements SortedMap, so all elements are stored in natural ordering (or a custom comparator if provided).
