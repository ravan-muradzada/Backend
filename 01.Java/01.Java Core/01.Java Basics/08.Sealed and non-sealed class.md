In Java, sealed and non-sealed classes control which classes can inherit from a specific class. They were introduced in Java 15 as part of Project Amber to improve control over inheritance, providing more flexibility and security in class hierarchies.

1. Sealed Classes

A sealed class restricts which classes can extend it. You declare a sealed class using the sealed keyword, and then specify the allowed subclasses with the permits keyword. This feature allows you to limit inheritance to a specific set of subclasses.

public sealed class A permits B, C { }

public final class B extends A { }

public final class C extends A { }


The derived class of sealed inherited class should be either final class or non-sealed class.

If the derived class is final, no other class can inherit from this derived class.



2. Non-sealed Classes

A non-sealed class allows unrestricted inheritance for one of the allowed subclasses. Itâ€™s declared with the non-sealed keyword, meaning it can be extended by any other class, not just those specified in permits.

public sealed A permits B, C { }

public final class B extends A { }

public non-sealed class C extend A {}

public class D extend C { }


In this example A is sealed class, so just B and C can inherit it.
B is final class, so no class can extend it.
C is non-sealed class, so other classess like D can inherit it.


-------------------------------------------

The same feature is also available for interfaces.
So interfaces can be also sealeed, so just specified classess can implement them.
And the classes which implement the interface also should be either final or non-sealed.
