In Java, the native keyword is used to declare a method that is implemented in another programming language, such as C or C++. This means that while the methodâ€™s signature is defined in Java, its actual implementation resides in a native library. To facilitate communication between Java and native code, the *Java Native Interface (JNI)* is used. JNI provides a set of APIs that enable Java code to call functions written in other languages and vice versa, allowing interaction with system-level operations or legacy libraries not available directly in Java. On the other hand, the *@Deprecated* annotation is used to mark classes, methods, or fields that are outdated and should no longer be used. It serves as a warning to developers that the element might be removed in future versions or replaced by a better alternative. This annotation often includes a Javadoc comment suggesting the preferred replacement and explaining why the element is deprecated, guiding developers on how to update their code accordingly.
