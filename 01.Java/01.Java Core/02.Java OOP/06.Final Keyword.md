In Java, the `final` keyword is used to make something unchangeable or constant. It can be applied to variables, methods, and classes, each serving a different purpose:

- **Final Variables**: When you declare a variable as `final`, its value cannot be changed once it is assigned. For example, if you declare `final int number = 10;`, you can't later change `number` to a different value. This is useful for constants that should remain the same throughout your code.

- **Final Methods**: If you declare a method as `final`, it cannot be overridden by any subclasses. This means that no subclass can provide a new implementation of this method. This is useful when you want to ensure that a method behaves exactly the same way in all subclasses.

-  **Final Classes**: When a class is declared as `final`, it cannot be subclassed. In other words, no other class can extend a `final` class. This is useful when you want to prevent inheritance and ensure that the classâ€™s behavior remains unchanged.

Using `final` helps in writing reliable code by enforcing immutability and preventing unintended changes or extensions.
