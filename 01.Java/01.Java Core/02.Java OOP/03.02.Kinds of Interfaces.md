In Java, there are several types of interfaces based on their purpose and usage:


- Marker Interface:

	- An empty interface with no methods (e.g., Serializable, Cloneable).
	- Used to mark classes with specific properties, allowing Java to identify certain behaviors.


- Functional Interface:

	- An interface with a single abstract method (SAM).
	- Examples: Runnable, Callable, Comparator.
	- Often used with lambda expressions for concise code.


- Normal Interface:

	- A regular interface with multiple methods.
	- Used to define a common behavior for implementing classes.


- Tagging Interface:

	- Similar to a marker interface but specifically to indicate or tag a class with a certain feature.
	- Example: An interface with specific naming conventions, used mainly for identification.


- Annotated Interface:

	- Interfaces annotated with annotations, often in custom setups for frameworks or configuration.
	- Interfaces define methods that implementing classes need to use, supporting polymorphism and making code modular and extensible.
