In Java, *interfaces* can contain various types of methods, each serving different purposes. Abstract methods are the core contract in an interface, lacking a body and requiring implementing classes to provide an implementation. There are default, static and private methods in interfaces, too. The default methods are the methods which can be used or overrided from subclasses of interface. Static methods are for just interfaces and used without creating any instance. Private methods are methods that are only available inside the interface.

When a variable is declared with an interface type in Java, it can only hold references to objects of classes that implement that interface. Any class assigned to such a variable must implement the interface, meaning it must provide concrete implementations for all the methods defined in the interface. This ensures that the class adheres to the contract specified by the interface, allowing the variable to be used consistently regardless of the specific class implementation.
