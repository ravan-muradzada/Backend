After dowloading TomCat and configure it, we can use it and create a new web page.

In programming, we use HTML to work with web pages and here in webapp we should create index.html.

Here we should write specific data. Imagine we need to take inputs from user.
We can add this to index.html file:

<form action="add">
		Enter 1st number: <input type="text" name="firstNumber"><br>
		Enter 2st number: <input type="text" name="secondNumber"><br>
		<input type="submit">
	</form>

However, how to handle with these inputs? 

In src folder, we should create a java class and inside this we should extend "HttpServlet" class and call service(..) method.
This method takes two parameters:

	HttpServletRequest request, 
	HttpServletResponse response.

To get inputs from webpage, we can write this code spinnet:

	int firstNumber = Integer.parseInt(req.getParameter("firstNumber"));
	int secondNumber = Integer.parseInt(req.getParameter("secondNumber"));	
	int sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;


How to print the result on the web page?

For that, we should create an object of PrintWriter class using this method: 

	PrintWriter output = res.getWriter();

Then we can write: 

	output.println("Result: " + sum);


You can see the coded in the next files.

However, we need to add this servlet to xml file. So, there we will create two tags:  \<servlet\> and \<servlet-mapping\>.
