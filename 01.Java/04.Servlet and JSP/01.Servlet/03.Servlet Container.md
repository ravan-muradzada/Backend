A Servlet Container (also known as a Servlet Engine) is a part of a web server or application server that manages and runs Servlets. It handles requests and responses, manages the lifecycle of Servlets, and provides a runtime environment for them.

Key Functions of a Servlet Container:

-Request Handling: It receives HTTP requests from the client (browser) and forwards them to the appropriate Servlet.
-Servlet Lifecycle Management: It creates, initializes, and destroys Servlets as needed.
-Response Handling: After processing the request, it sends the response back to the client.
-Session Management: It manages sessions, cookies, and state between requests.
