#servlet #jsp

You have already know what are Servlet and JSP and their difference. For more information:
[[01.What is Servlet?|What is Servlet?]]
[[01.What is JSP?|What is JSP?]]

Mostly, they do the same thing and in the behind of the scene all JSP files are converted to Servlet file. However, writing HTML code in JSP easily gives it some preference in some cases.

In real life, it is not recommended to write the details of the main code in JSP, so it is used to print, view the result for client. 

> [!INFO] Overall Process
> Programmer should write main code about the process in **Servlet Class**. Then the data (which should be shown to clients) will be send to **JSP** file. In **JSP** file, using both **Java** and **HTML** code, the data will be printed properly. While sending data from **Servlet** to **JSP**, we can use methods like **RequestDispatcher** or **Session** and etc.


> [!INFO] Getting data from Servlet to JSP
> We have also a specific method to print the data in JSP which was set in Servlet. If we set its with this name:  **demoName**, we should write  this in JSP: `${demoName}`. We do not need any **<% %>** for this.
