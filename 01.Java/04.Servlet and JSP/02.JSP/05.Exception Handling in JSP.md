#jsp #exceptions

To get more information about overall *Exceptions*: [[03.Exceptions|Exceptions]]

Of course, we can handle the exceptions in JSP file as Java. So we can use just **throws** or **try-catch** block for them. However, there is an easier and specific way to do it in JSP.
We can just create a new JSP file for exceptions and here use an **exception** object which is one of the implicit objects in JSP.  To activate this object to use we should add this to **Directive Tag**:
	`isErrorPage = "true"`
Then we can use this expression to print an error message 
	`exception.getMessage()`
This message should be written in an expression tag.

To be able to use this error message for our current main jsp file, we should import this exception file.

Let's look at an example. 

Main JSP file:

	<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8"
	pageEncoding="UTF-8" errorPage="error.jsp" %>
	<%@page import="java.util.*" %>
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Insert title here</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<%
			int i = 5, j = 0;
			int k = i / j;
			
			out.println("Result: " + k);
		%>
	</body>
	</html>



To handle the exception here, I have created a exception file:

	<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8"
	pageEncoding="UTF-8" isErrorPage="true" %>
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Insert title here</title>
	</head>
	<body bgcolor="red">
		<%= exception.getMessage() %>
	</body>
	</html>
