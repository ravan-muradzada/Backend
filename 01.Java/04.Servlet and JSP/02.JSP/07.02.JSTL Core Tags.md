#jstl #jsp #tags 

To be able to learn and use some JSTL tags, of course we should import the proper library. In JSP file, `@taglib` from **Directive Tag** will help us.

> [!INFO] **JSTL** Configuration
> To be able to use tags in **JSTL**, we should import this library: `http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core`.
>
> So, using **taglib**, we should write something like that:
> `<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>`
> We will use **c** as prefix for JSTL tags. 
> 
> To be able to import this library, first we should download it from the internet, like [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/). Then we need to put it to ***lib*** library. Its relative path from **Application Folder**:
> `./src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib`.



### Some Tags in JSTL

#### 1) out

It is simply used to print some data in the web page. Its syntax is like that:
	`<c:out value = "Hello World From JSTL!"/>`
We use `value` keyword to mention the  text which should be printed.

It is possible to print here the values from dispatching like that:
	`<c:out value="${number}" />`

*Here **number** is dispatched value from the servlet.*


#### 2) import

It helps us to import any webpage, its syntax is like that:
	`<c:import url="https://github.com/"/>`
