#jstl 

**JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library)** is a collection of custom tags for JSP (JavaServer Pages) that simplifies the development of dynamic web applications by reducing the need to write Java code directly in JSP files. It provides a clean and standardized way to manage common tasks like iteration, conditionals, formatting, and interacting with databases.

It provides us a lot of tags to use while writing JSP.

#### Why Use JSTL?

1. **Simplifies Development**: Reduces the need for Java code in JSP files, improving readability and maintainability.
2. **Standardized**: Provides a consistent way to implement common functionalities across projects.
3. **Improves Separation of Concerns**: Helps keep business logic separate from presentation logic.
