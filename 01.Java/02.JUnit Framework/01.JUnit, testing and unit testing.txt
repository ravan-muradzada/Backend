JUnit is a popular testing framework in Java, primarily used for unit testing. It provides tools and annotations for creating and running tests, allowing developers to verify that small parts of code (usually individual methods or classes) work as expected. JUnit supports automated testing, making it easy to run many tests and check for code correctness quickly.

-----------------------------------------

What is unit-testing?

Unit testing is the process of testing individual parts (units) of a program in isolation from the rest of the application. The main goal of unit testing is to confirm that each unit behaves correctly. In Java, a unit often refers a single class or method.

The difference between testing and unit testing

Testing - This is the general process of checking application to find errors and verify its functinality. 

Unit Testing - A subset of testing focused specifically on small, isolated units, usually implemented by the developers themselves during coding. Unit testing helps ensure each part of the code works as intended before integration with other parts of the application.

Unit testing is done by developer itself, however traditional testings are mostly done by testing engineers of other members of the team.
