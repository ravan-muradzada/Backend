In JUnit, assertTrue and assertFalse are assertions used to validate boolean conditions in tests. They check if a condition is true or false and fail the test if the condition doesn't match the expected outcome. These assertions are helpful for confirming specific conditions within the logic of your code.


assertTrue

assertTrue checks if a condition is true. If the condition is false, the test fails, and JUnit will throw an AssertionFailedError.

Syntax:
assertTrue(condition, "Optional failure message");

assertFalse

assertFalse checks if a condition is false. If the condition is true, the test fails.
