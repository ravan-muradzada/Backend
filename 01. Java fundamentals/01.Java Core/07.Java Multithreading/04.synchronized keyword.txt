The synchronized keyword in Java is used to control the access of multiple threads to a shared resource (like an object or a method) to ensure thread safety. It ensures that only one thread can execute a block of code (or a method) at a time while holding the lock on the object that is being synchronized. This prevents race conditions, where multiple threads try to modify or read shared data simultaneously, which could lead to inconsistent results or corrupt the state.

Key Concepts of the synchronized Keyword:

-Mutual Exclusion: Only one thread can access the synchronized block or method at a time, ensuring no other thread can enter it until the current thread exits, which helps to avoid data inconsistencies.

-Locking Mechanism: The synchronized keyword uses a lock or monitor on the object or class. Before entering a synchronized block, a thread must acquire the lock on that object or class. If another thread already holds the lock, the new thread will be blocked until the lock is released.

-Types of Synchronization:

    --Synchronized Method: Locks the entire method so that only one thread can execute the entire method at a time.
    --Synchronized Block: Locks only a specific block of code within a method. This is used when you only need to synchronize access to a particular part of the code, which can lead to better performance compared to synchronizing the entire method.
