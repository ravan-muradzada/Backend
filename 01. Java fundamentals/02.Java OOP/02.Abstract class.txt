Abstract class - In Java, abstract classes are a fundamental tool for creating a base class that provides both common behavior and a framework for subclasses.
An abstract class cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be extended by other classes. It can contain abstract methods, which are declared without a body and must be implemented by subclasses, thereby enforcing a contract that the subclass must fulfill. Additionally, abstract classes can have concrete methods with a body, allowing subclasses to inherit common behavior directly or override it as needed. Unlike interfaces, abstract classes can also have instance variables and constructors, which can be used to initialize state that will be shared among the subclasses. This makes abstract classes particularly useful when you want to provide some shared code along with a set of methods that subclasses are required to implement, offering a balanced approach between full abstraction and code reuse.
