In Java, a String is an object that represents a sequence of characters, like text. Strings are one of the most used data types in Java and are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.

Immutable Strings:

Immutable means that once a String object is created, its value canâ€™t be changed.

For example, String s = "Hello"; creates a String. If you do s = s + " World";, it creates a new String instead of modifying the old one.

Benefits of immutability: It's safer for memory, efficient in multithreading, and allows for string pooling, which saves memory.


Mutable Strings:

Mutable means the object can be changed after creation.

In Java, StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable alternatives. You can modify the contents without creating new objects.

StringBuilder is faster but not thread-safe.
StringBuffer is slower but thread-safe.

-------------------------------------------

String: Immutable, safe, and efficient for read-only text.

StringBuilder / StringBuffer: Mutable, better for frequent text modifications.
