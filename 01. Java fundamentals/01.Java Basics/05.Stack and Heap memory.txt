Stack and Heap are two areas of memory in Java with different purposes:

1. Stack Memory:

-Stores method calls and local variables.
-Each method call creates a "stack frame" to keep track of its variables and execution order.
-Fast but limited in size.
-Memory is automatically freed when a method finishes.

2. Heap Memory

-Stores objects and global variables.
-Shared across all parts of the program.
-Larger but slower to access than the stack.
-Managed by Garbage Collection, which removes unused objects.


Stack: Short-term, for methods and variables.
Heap: Long-term, for objects and shared data.
