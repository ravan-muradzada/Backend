Interactive rebase (rebase -i) is a feature in Git that allows you to rewrite and clean up your commit history by editing, reordering, squashing, or even removing commits before integrating them into a new base. It gives you much more control over how commits are handled compared to a regular rebase.

To be able to do this stuff we need to write something like that:
git rebase -i HEAD~4


There are some Interactive rebase modes:

1) pick - that is default, no change is anywhere.

2) reword (r) - It keeps the commit's changes, but edit the commit message.

3) edit (e) - allows you to pause the rebase process at a specific commit, so you can modify its content (such as changing files, adding or removing changes) or even amend the commit message. It gives you complete control over a commit.

4) squash (s) - allows you to combine multiple commits into one, merging the changes from those commits while giving you the option to modify or merge the commit messages. This is useful when you have multiple small commits that logically belong together and you want to keep your Git history cleaner by reducing them to a single commit.

5) fixup (f) - The fixup option in Git's interactive rebase is similar to squash, but with one key difference: it discards the commit message of the commit being fixed and uses only the message from the previous commit. Itâ€™s used when you want to make a quick, small adjustment or fix to a previous commit without altering the commit history too much, keeping the focus on the main commit message.

6) drop (d) - The drop option in an interactive rebase allows you to completely remove a commit from the history. When you use drop, the commit is discarded, meaning its changes will no longer be present after the rebase is completed. This is useful when a commit is unnecessary, contains mistakes, or is irrelevant to the current project.
