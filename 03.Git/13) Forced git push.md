In Git, both `git push -f` and `git push --force-with-lease` are used to forcefully push changes to a remote branch, but they have different safety implications.

### 1. `git push -f` (Force Push)
- **What it does**: This command forcefully overwrites the remote branch with your local changes, regardless of any changes on the remote that may have occurred after your last fetch or pull.
- **Use case**: It's often used when you rewrite history locally (e.g., after a rebase or amending commits) and want to push these changes to the remote.
- **Risk**: It can be dangerous because it overwrites the remote history, potentially deleting others' work if they have pushed commits after your last fetch. This can lead to loss of commits if not handled carefully.

### 2. `git push --force-with-lease`
- **What it does**: This is a safer alternative to `git push -f`. It forcefully pushes your changes, but only if no one else has pushed new commits to the remote branch since your last pull or fetch. It "leases" the state of the remote branch at the time of your last fetch and ensures that the remote hasn't changed unexpectedly.
- **Use case**: It's useful when you're rebasing or amending commits but want to ensure that you're not overwriting someone else's recent work on the remote branch.
- **Safety**: This command checks whether the remote branch has diverged from your local branch before forcing the push. If the remote has changed, it will abort the push, preventing accidental overwrites.

### Key Differences
- **`git push -f`**: Overwrites remote changes without any checks.
- **`git push --force-with-lease`**: Ensures the remote hasn't changed since your last fetch/pull, making it safer to use in collaborative environments.
