Git rebase is a powerful Git command that allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving or "rebasing" your commits on top of another base commit. It is an alternative to merging and can result in a cleaner, linear project history.

Rebasing in Git is a technique used to streamline and maintain a clean project history. It allows you to take commits from one branch and apply them on top of another branch's latest changes, creating a linear and straightforward history. Most commonly, rebasing is used with feature branches to integrate them smoothly with the latest updates from the base branch (like `master`). This helps avoid merge commits and keeps the project history clear and easy to follow. Rebasing works by moving the base of your feature branch to the tip of the target branch, effectively replaying your commits as if they were made after the latest changes. While rebasing feature branches is a common practice to keep them up-to-date, directly rebasing the master branch is less frequent and should be done cautiously, as it involves rewriting history and requires force-pushing to update remote branches. Understanding when and how to use rebasing helps maintain a clean and organized Git history, ensuring a smoother workflow and easier project management.

The difference between `git rebase` and `git pull --rebase` lies in how and when they are used. `git rebase` is typically used to move or "replay" your local commits on top of another branch, like `main`, which helps create a cleaner, linear history without extra merge commits. It only affects local branches and doesnâ€™t pull any new changes from the remote. On the other hand, `git pull --rebase` is a specific command used to update your current branch with changes from a remote branch, but instead of merging them (which would create a new merge commit), it pulls the new changes and rebases your local commits on top of them. This ensures that your local work comes after the latest remote changes, keeping the history clean without unnecessary merges. While `git rebase` is focused on restructuring local commit history, `git pull --rebase` integrates remote changes while keeping your commits tidy.
