In Java, static methods are different from regular instance methods because they belong to the class itself, not to any object. This means they cannot be overridden in the same way that instance methods can. Instead, when you declare a static method in a subclass with the same signature as one in the parent class, you're not overriding it—you're hiding it. The method that gets called is determined by the reference type at compile-time, not by the actual object's type at runtime. 

For example, if you have a reference of a parent class pointing to a child class object and you call a static method, the parent class's static method will be executed, not the child's. This happens because static method calls are resolved based on the reference type during compilation. 

This might make it seem like the "overridden" static method in the subclass is useless for objects, but it's important to remember that static methods are meant to be called on the class itself, not on objects. If you call the static method directly on the subclass, the subclass's version will be used. So, the static method in the subclass isn't useless, but it's not tied to the object in the way instance methods are. It's more about how you're calling the method—through the class or through an object reference.
