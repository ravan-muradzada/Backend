In Java, annotations are metadata added to classes, methods, variables, or other code elements to provide extra information for the compiler or runtime. They donâ€™t change the behavior of the code directly but can be used by tools and libraries to process code or make decisions at runtime.

##### Why Use Annotations?

-Code Instructions: Annotations give hints to the compiler or runtime about how to handle certain elements.
-Configuration: Annotations can replace external XML configurations (like in frameworks).
-Documentation: Some annotations serve as documentation for other developers.
