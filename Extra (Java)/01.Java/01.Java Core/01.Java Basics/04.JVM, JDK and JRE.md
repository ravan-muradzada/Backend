JDK (Java Development Kit): The full package for Java development. It includes:

Compiler: Turns code into bytecode.
JRE: To run Java programs.
Libraries: To develop and debug Java apps.

---------------------------------------

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Runs Java bytecode on any device. Itâ€™s platform-independent, meaning it runs the same code on Windows, Linux, etc.

---------------------------------------

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The environment to run Java programs. It has the JVM and libraries but lacks tools for development (like a compiler).



JDK = JRE + Compiler + ToolsForDevelopment

JRE = JVM + Libraries

JVM = Runs the bytecode
