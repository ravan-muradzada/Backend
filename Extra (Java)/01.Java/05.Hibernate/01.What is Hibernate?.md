#### What is Hibernate?

Hibernate is a **Java-based Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework** that simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa. It eliminates the need to write complex SQL queries for CRUD operations.

#### Why do we need Hibernate?

1. **Database Independence:** Works with multiple databases without requiring changes in code.
2. **Simplified Development:** Reduces boilerplate code for database operations.
3. **Caching:** Improves performance through first-level and second-level caching.
4. **Automatic Schema Generation:** Can generate database schema from Java classes.
5. **Lazy Loading:** Fetches data only when needed, reducing resource usage.
