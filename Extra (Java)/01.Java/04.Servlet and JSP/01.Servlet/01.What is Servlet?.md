A Servlet is a Java class used to create dynamic web pages. It runs on the server side, processes requests from the client (browser), and sends back responses.

Why do we use it?

1. To handle HTTP requests (like GET, POST).
2. To connect web applications to a database or other back-end systems.
3. To generate dynamic content (e.g., forms, data, etc.).

Example:

Imagine a login form:
- User enters username and password.
- Servlet checks the database to verify credentials.
- Servlet sends a response:
    "Login successful" if correct.
    "Invalid credentials" if wrong.


How does it work?

These steps happened:

1. Client sends a request: A browser sends an HTTP request (e.g., typing a URL or submitting a form).

2. Request reaches the server: The web server forwards this request to the Servlet.

3. Servlet processes the request: It performs tasks like accessing the database or applying business logic.

4. Servlet sends a response: The processed data is returned as an HTML page to the browser.
