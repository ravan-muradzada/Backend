For more information about JSTL: [[07.01.What is JSTL?|What is JSTL?]]

There are also some functional tags in JSTL which helps us to use some methods, especially string methods.

We should import the specific library like that:

	<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions" prefix="fn" %>

#### 1) length
It is used to find the length of the string.

#### 2) index
It helps us to find an index of (a) character(s) in the string.

#### 3) contains
It helps us to determine specific (a) character(s) contains in the string or not.

#### 4) endsWith
It determines the string ends with the given a partion string.

----

Example Code for the methods:


	<body>
		<c:set var="str" value="Java is an amazing Programming Language" />
		
		<p> Length of str: ${fn:length(str)}</p>
		
		<c:out value="Splitted version of the sentence:" />
		<c:forEach items="${fn:split(str, ' ')}" var="word">
			<br>
			<c:out value="${word}" />
		</c:forEach>
		
		<p> index: ${fn:indexOf(str, "is")}</p>
		
		<p>contains or not: ${fn:contains(str, "Java")} </p>
		
		<c:if test="${fn: endsWith(str, 'Language')}">
			You are right
		</c:if>
	</body>

As you can see, we also can use `if` statement in JSP.
