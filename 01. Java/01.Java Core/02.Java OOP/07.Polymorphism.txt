Polymorphism in Java is a concept that allows one action to behave differently based on the object that is performing the action. In simple terms, it means "many forms." For example, when you have a method in a parent class and that method is also present in a child class, if you call the method on an object of the child class, the version of the method from the child class will be executed. However, if the method is not overridden in the child class, the method from the parent class will be executed instead. This allows a single method to work in different ways based on the object it's acting on.

There are two main types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time (or static) polymorphism and runtime (or dynamic) polymorphism. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters within the same class. The method that gets called is determined at compile time based on the method signature. Runtime polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where a method in a subclass has the same name and signature as a method in its superclass. Here, the method that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the actual object's class.

Polymorphism makes code more flexible and reusable because it allows you to use objects of different classes interchangeably if they share the same interface or superclass. This leads to easier maintenance and the ability to introduce new functionality without modifying existing code.
