In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, fields, and constructors. There are four main types of access modifiers:

1. **Public:** When something is marked as `public`, it means it can be accessed from anywhere in the program. For example, a public method or field can be used by any class, no matter where it is located.

2. **Protected:** The `protected` modifier allows access within the same package and also by subclasses, even if they are in different packages. This means that `protected` methods or fields can be used by classes in the same package and by subclasses that extend the class, even if those subclasses are in different packages.

3. **Default (Package-Private):** If no access modifier is specified, Java uses the default access level, which is also known as package-private. This means the element is only accessible within the same package. It's a way to allow classes in the same package to interact with each other while keeping those interactions hidden from classes in other packages.

4. **Private:** The `private` modifier restricts access so that the element can only be used within the same class. No other class, including subclasses, can access private fields or methods. This is useful for hiding implementation details and protecting the integrity of the classâ€™s data.

Each modifier serves a different purpose and helps in organizing and securing your code. Using `public` lets you expose parts of your class to other parts of your program, while `protected` and default access are useful for controlling visibility within packages and subclasses. `Private` is essential for keeping data safe from unintended access and modification.
