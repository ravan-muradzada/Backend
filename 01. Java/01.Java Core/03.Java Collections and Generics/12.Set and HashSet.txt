The Set interface in Java is part of the Java Collections Framework, and it represents a collection that:

-Does not allow duplicate elements.
-Does not guarantee any specific order (except for specific implementations like LinkedHashSet or TreeSet).

The Set interface extends the Collection interface and has various implementations with different properties regarding order, performance, and thread safety.


--------------------------------------------------------

Overview of Set Implementations

Each implementation of the Set interface has its unique characteristics:

-HashSet: Unordered, allows null, uses hashing for fast access.
-LinkedHashSet: Ordered by insertion, uses a linked list to maintain order, still uses hashing for lookup.
-TreeSet: Sorted set that maintains elements in a natural or custom sorted order using a Red-Black tree.
-EnumSet: Special-purpose set for working with enum constants.
-CopyOnWriteArraySet: Thread-safe version that is useful when read operations far outnumber write operations.


1. HashSet

-HashSet is the most commonly used implementation of the Set interface.
-No ordering: Elements are not stored in a particular order.
-Underlying data structure: Hash table (backed by a HashMap internally).
-Performance: Offers constant-time performance (O(1)) for basic operations like add, remove, contains, and size.

-Null: HashSet allows one null value.
-Performance: It provides constant time for operations (O(1)), assuming a good hash function is used.


2. LinkedHashSet

-LinkedHashSet maintains the order of insertion.
-It extends HashSet and internally uses a doubly linked list along with a hash table.
-This is useful when you need fast lookups with predictable iteration order.

-Maintains Insertion Order: Preserves the order in which elements were added.
-Performance: Slightly slower than HashSet due to the linked list overhead but still provides O(1) for basic operations.


3. TreeSet

-TreeSet stores elements in a sorted order.
-Internally, it uses a Red-Black tree (a self-balancing binary search tree), so operations like add, remove, and contains take logarithmic time (O(log n)).

-Sorted: Maintains elements in their natural or custom order (if you provide a Comparator).
-Performance: Provides O(log n) performance for all operations.


4. Thread-safe implementations of Set

    1. Synchronized wrappers: 
        You can wrap any Set to make it thread-safe:
        Set<String> synchronizedSet = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());

    2. CopyOnWriteArraySet (from java.util.concurrent):
        -This set provides thread safety by copying the entire underlying array when the set is modified.
        -This is useful when read operations are far more frequent than write operations.


5. EnumSet

-EnumSet is a highly efficient Set implementation designed for use with enum types.
-It can only store elements of a single enum type.
-Internally, it is backed by a bit vector which allows very fast access and minimal memory usage.

-Efficient: Very fast and memory efficient.
-Operations: All basic Set operations are supported.
