In Java, Comparator and Comparable are both used for sorting objects, but they serve different purposes and are implemented in distinct ways. Let's break down each concept.

1) What is Comparator?

Comparator is an interface in Java that is used to define a custom sorting order for objects that do not have a natural ordering or when you want to apply different sorting criteria.

A Comparator provides a method called compare(T o1, T o2) that compares two objects of type T and returns:
    
    A negative integer if the first object is less than the second.

    Zero if the two objects are equal.

    A positive integer if the first object is greater than the second.


You can implement Comparator in cases where:

You want to sort objects in a way thatâ€™s different from their natural order.

You need multiple sorting criteria.


How to sort elements in a list using Comparator?

You can sort elements in a list by passing a Comparator to methods like Collections.sort() or using the sort() method on the List itself.


2) What is Comparable?

Comparable is another interface in Java that is used to define the natural ordering of objects. When a class implements Comparable, it needs to provide the implementation of the compareTo() method, which is used to compare the current object with another object of the same type.

The compareTo(T o) method returns:
    
    A negative integer if the current object is less than the specified object.
    
    Zero if the two objects are equal.
    
    A positive integer if the current object is greater than the specified object.


-----------------------------------------------------

Difference Between compare() and compareTo() Methods:

compareTo():
    Defined in the Comparable interface.
    Compares the current object (this) with another object of the same type.
    Used to define the natural ordering of objects.

compare():
    Defined in the Comparator interface.
    Compares two objects of the same type.
    Used to define a custom ordering of objects.

Where to Use Comparator and Comparable?

Use Comparable when:

You want to define a default or natural ordering for the objects.
The comparison logic should be part of the class itself.
Example: If cars should always be ordered by price, you can implement Comparable in the Car class.
Use Comparator when:

You want to define multiple or custom sorting criteria.
The sorting logic is external to the class, or the class itself should not define its ordering.
Example: You might want to sort cars by price, but in some cases by brand name or model year. For this, you'd use different Comparator implementations.
