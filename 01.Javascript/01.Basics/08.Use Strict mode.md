### **`"use strict"` Mode in JavaScript**

`"use strict"` is a directive in JavaScript that enables **strict mode**, which makes the code execution more secure and reliable by enforcing stricter parsing and error handling.

### **How to Enable Strict Mode**

1. **Globally**: Add `"use strict";` at the top of a script file. This applies strict mode to the entire script.
    
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    
    let x = 10; // Valid in strict mode
    y = 20;     // Throws an error: 'y' is not declared
    ```
    
2. **Function Scope**: Add `"use strict";` inside a function to apply strict mode only within that function.
    
    ```javascript
    function myFunction() {
        "use strict";
        let x = 10; // Valid
        y = 20;     // Throws an error
    }
    
    myFunction();
    ```

### **Why Use Strict Mode?**

Strict mode helps developers avoid common mistakes and improves the robustness of the code. It achieves this by:

1. **Preventing the Use of Undeclared Variables**:
    
    - In non-strict mode, assigning a value to an undeclared variable creates it in the global scope. Strict mode throws an error.
    
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    x = 10; // Error: x is not defined
    ```
    
2. **Eliminating Silent Errors**:
    
    - Some actions fail silently in normal mode but throw errors in strict mode.
    
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    let obj = Object.freeze({ name: "Quli" });
    obj.name = "Changed"; // Error: Cannot assign to a read-only property
    ```
    
3. **Restricting `this`**:
    
    - In strict mode, `this` is `undefined` in functions that are called without a context (e.g., outside of an object).
    
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    function showThis() {
        console.log(this); // Undefined instead of the global object
    }
    showThis();
    ```
    
4. **Disallowing Duplicate Parameter Names**:
    
    - Strict mode prevents functions from having duplicate parameter names.
    
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    function myFunc(a, a) { // Error
        return a;
    }
    ```
    
5. **Prohibiting Certain Syntax**:
    
    - Strict mode blocks the use of some features that are deprecated or considered unsafe.
    
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    with (Math) { // Error: 'with' is not allowed in strict mode
        console.log(PI);
    }
    ```

### **Benefits of Strict Mode**:

- Helps catch common coding mistakes.
- Prevents accidental creation of global variables.
- Makes debugging easier by throwing errors instead of failing silently.
- Ensures future-proof code by disallowing deprecated syntax.

### **When to Use Strict Mode?**

- Always use `"use strict"` in your code, especially for modern JavaScript development, as it enhances security and reliability. It is especially useful when writing ES5-compatible code. For ES6+ modules, strict mode is enabled by default.
