Both `const` and `Object.freeze()` are used to prevent changes to variables and objects, but they work in different ways and apply to different scopes.

---

### **1. `const` in JavaScript**

- **`const`** is used to declare variables whose value should not be reassigned.
- **Scope**: The variable declared with `const` is block-scoped, meaning it only exists within the block (enclosed in `{}`) where it was defined.
- **Immutability**: `const` ensures that the **binding** (the reference to the value) cannot be changed, but it **does not make the value itself immutable**.

#### **Key Points**:

- The value of a `const` variable cannot be reassigned.
- Objects or arrays declared with `const` can still have their properties or elements modified (the reference is constant, not the value).

#### **Examples**:

```javascript
const x = 10;   // x is a constant, can't be reassigned
x = 20;         // Error: Assignment to constant variable.

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);    // This is allowed because we can modify the contents of the array.
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### **2. `Object.freeze()` in JavaScript**

- **`Object.freeze()`** is used to make an object **immutable** (its properties cannot be added, modified, or deleted).
- It works on **objects** only, and it makes the object **shallowly immutable**. This means the top-level properties are frozen, but nested objects or arrays within the object are still mutable unless explicitly frozen.
- **`Object.freeze()`** does not prevent the object's reference from being changed (unlike `const`).

#### **Key Points**:

- **Shallow immutability**: Only the immediate properties of the object are frozen, and nested objects can still be modified.
- **No effect on primitive values**: You can't freeze primitives (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans).

#### **Examples**:

```javascript
const obj = { name: "Quli", age: 25 };
Object.freeze(obj);

obj.name = "Ali";   // Error in strict mode: Cannot assign to read only property 'name'
delete obj.age;    // Error in strict mode: Cannot delete property 'age'

console.log(obj);   // { name: "Quli", age: 25 }
```

### **Key Differences**:

|Feature|`const`|`Object.freeze()`|
|---|---|---|
|**What it affects**|Variable binding (re-assignment)|Properties of an object|
|**Scope**|Block-scoped|Applies to the object, not its reference|
|**Immutability**|Does not make the value itself immutable (can mutate object/array contents)|Makes the object properties immutable (shallowly)|
|**Works with**|Variables, arrays, objects|Only objects|

---

### **Combining `const` and `Object.freeze()`**:

If you want an object to be both **constant** (cannot reassign the object) and **immutable** (cannot modify the properties of the object), you can use both `const` and `Object.freeze()` together:

```javascript
const person = { name: "Quli", age: 25 };
Object.freeze(person);

person.name = "Ali";  // Error: Cannot assign to read only property 'name'
person = {};          // Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

In this case:

- The **reference** to `person` cannot be reassigned because of `const`.
- The **properties** of `person` cannot be modified because of `Object.freeze()`.
