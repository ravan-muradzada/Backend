Sometimes, in code there is some spinnets which can take some time which can stop the other process to be done. We can want to continue without waiting their outputs to execute other parts of the code. In this case, we should use asynchronous functions, so the program does not wait for them. *setTimeOut function is the basic example of that kind of functions.*

#### When we can need that kind of thing?
- Reading File
- Networking Requests
- Interacting with Databases

#### What is callback function?
A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function, allowing the latter to execute the callback at a specified time or event. Callback functions enable **asynchronous** or **event-driven** programming.

#### Example Code

```javascript
const add = (num1, num2, callback) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        let res = num1 + num2;
        callback(res);
    }, 2000)
}

add(1, 4, (sum)=> console.log(sum));
// the third parameter is actually a function which is called when we call callback(...).
```

The function is called and a result is found and then in callback function the result is printed to console.
