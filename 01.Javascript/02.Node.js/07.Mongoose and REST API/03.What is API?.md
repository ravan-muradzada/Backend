### **What is an API?**

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is like a bridge that allows two different software systems to communicate with each other. It defines a set of rules and protocols for how one system can request data or services from another.

Imagine you're at a restaurant. The **menu** is like an API – it tells you what dishes (services) are available. The **waiter** is like the API request – you ask the waiter (the API) for a dish, and the waiter communicates your order to the kitchen (the server). Once the kitchen prepares your dish (the response), the waiter brings it back to you.

In the world of software, an API is like this waiter, taking requests, processing them, and then returning the results. APIs are commonly used to allow applications to interact with each other, like when you use a weather app on your phone to get data from a weather service.
