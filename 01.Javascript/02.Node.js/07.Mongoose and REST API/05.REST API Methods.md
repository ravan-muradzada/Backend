The main methods in a REST API are the HTTP methods used to perform operations on resources. These methods correspond to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Here’s a summary of the main HTTP methods:

---

### **1. GET**

- **Purpose**: Retrieve data from the server.
- **Operation**: Read.
- **Example Use Case**:
    - Fetching a list of users: `GET /users`
    - Fetching details of a specific user: `GET /users/1`
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Safe**: Doesn’t modify any data.
    - **Idempotent**: Repeated calls produce the same result.

---

### **2. POST**

- **Purpose**: Send data to the server to create a new resource.
- **Operation**: Create.
- **Example Use Case**:
    - Registering a new user: `POST /users`
        
        ```json
        {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "email": "john@example.com"
        }
        ```
        
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Not idempotent**: Each call may create a new resource (e.g., multiple users with the same data).

---

### **3. PUT**

- **Purpose**: Update an existing resource or create it if it doesn’t exist.
- **Operation**: Update or Create.
- **Example Use Case**:
    - Updating user information: `PUT /users/1`
        
        ```json
        {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "email": "john@example.com"
        }
        ```
        
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Idempotent**: Multiple identical requests result in the same state.

---

### **4. PATCH**

- **Purpose**: Partially update an existing resource.
- **Operation**: Update.
- **Example Use Case**:
    - Updating only the email of a user: `PATCH /users/1`
        
        ```json
        {
          "email": "new-email@example.com"
        }
        ```
        
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Not necessarily idempotent**, but usually designed to be.

---

### **5. DELETE**

- **Purpose**: Remove a resource from the server.
- **Operation**: Delete.
- **Example Use Case**:
    - Deleting a user: `DELETE /users/1`
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Idempotent**: Repeated calls have the same effect (resource is deleted or doesn’t exist).

---

### Supporting Methods

While the above are the most common, other HTTP methods like `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `CONNECT` may also be used in REST APIs:

- **HEAD**: Same as `GET` but only retrieves headers, not the body.
- **OPTIONS**: Provides supported HTTP methods for a resource.
- **CONNECT**: Establishes a tunnel to the server (used for advanced networking scenarios).

### CRUD vs REST Methods

|**CRUD Operation**|**HTTP Method**|**Example Endpoint**|
|---|---|---|
|Create|POST|`/users`|
|Read|GET|`/users` or `/users/1`|
|Update (Replace)|PUT|`/users/1`|
|Update (Partial)|PATCH|`/users/1`|
|Delete|DELETE|`/users/1`|

While creating and testing our **Rest API**, we can create a basic front-end app to get, put or other operations the data from there. However, it has easier way, so we do not need to have front-end part. There are some tools which simulates front-end part of the server and send the request to us and we can appriciate it and do the specific process on the data in the request. One of that kind of tools is **Postman**.
We will use **Postman** in the next lectures to simulate front-end part and send the first request to us.
