Sometimes, we need to filter and validate uploaded files. Such us, we can make a maximum limit for the size of the file or accept only certain file types like *pdf, txt, png and so on*.
For all of these, we need to add some customizations to multer object we have created in [[01.Adding Support for file uploading|File Uploading]]

```javascript
const upload = multer({
    dest: 'avatars',
    limits: {
        fileSize: 1000000
    },
    fileFilter(req, file, callback) {
        if (!file.originalname.match(/\.(doc|docx)$/)){
            return cb(new Error('Please upload a word document!'));
        }

        callback(undefined, true);
    }
});
```
In `limits` part, we can set multiple restrictions for our document, however the main one is `fileSize`. In `fileFilter` method we filter the uploaded document  according to anything we want and need. Such as, we can check a file type and validate it. The last argument is `callback` function, if there was any error, we need to send just one argument and it should be error message. If everything is ok, we send two parameters: the first  should be `undefined` and the second one should be `true`.
