You know that we use Postman as our front-end webpage and in real time senarios, from frontend pages we accepted some files like images, documents or any kind of files. How to upload it to server. 
To be able to do that, we need to download specific npm module which is called `multer`. 
Imagine, we want to create a **REST API** method which is for just uploading files from the Postman. First, we need to import multer's module and then create its object in which we will initialize some functionalities like destination of uploaded files. This determines where they will be kept for uploaded files from Postman.

```javascript
// Remember its name: 'upload'
const upload = multer({
	// 'avatars' is folder name where the files will be uploaded from the front-end page or Postman.
    dest: 'avatars'
});
```
Then in our **REST** method, we need to give it a middleware and it will become `upload.single('avatar')`. 

```javascript
router.post('/users/me/avatar', upload.single('avatar'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Avatar is sent!');
});
```
----
In Postman part, we need to create a post request with this path. Then we need to go to Body/form-data. We should set a key and a value for it. The key must  be the same with the value inside `single` method. We select there `File` option and in value part, we need to upload our file from any part of the computer.

---
After this process, in our main project folder, there will be created a folder named **avatars** and inside it the file will become. We need to just give extension according to the type of the file.
