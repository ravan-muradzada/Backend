In default, while uploading a file, the server sends an error message as html format which is not readable a lot, especially in Postman. We may need to customize this format a little like to **JSON**. 
We can write our **REST** method like that:
```javascript
router.post('/users/me/avatar', upload.single('avatar'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Avatar is sent!');
}, (error, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(400).send({error: error.message});
});
```
In the second argument function, the error is handled and the error message from `fileFilter` method is returned in **JSON** format.
