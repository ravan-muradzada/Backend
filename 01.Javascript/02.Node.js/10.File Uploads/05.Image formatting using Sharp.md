We have learn how to create profile photo and work with them:
[[04.Working with images in User Profile|Working with images in User Profile]].

We may want to format the image when it is created. Such as, we may want to resize it (mostly shrinking it), or to convert it to another image format (like png, jpg and etc).

```javascript
router.post('/users/me/avatar', auth, upload.single('avatar'), async (req, res) => {
    const buffer = await sharp(req.file.buffer)
        .resize({ width: 250, height: 250 })
        .png()
        .toBuffer(); 
        // Because it is stored as buffer in db, 
        // we need to convert it to buffer.

    req.user.avatar = buffer;
    await req.user.save();
    res.send('Successfully done!');
}, (error, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(400).send({error: error.message});
});
```
