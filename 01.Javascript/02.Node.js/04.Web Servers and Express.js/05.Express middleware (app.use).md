Before the request reaches to the server itself and is handled, we can filter it in express's middlware and do some processes on that.
For that, we use `app.use(..)` method. Inside it, we need to write the function.

Example:
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('middleware passed!');
    next();
})

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Server part!');
})
```
In this example, the request comes to the middleware before it reaches to the main server partition. We should use `next` method to continue and allow the request to continue.

We may have multiple middlewares for the same requests. They will just be called sequentially.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('middleware 1 passed!');
    next();
})

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('middleware 2 passed!');
    next();
})

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Server part!');
})
```

-----
There is a specific middlewares for `app.use` function which is used as a parameter of it. One of them is `express.json()` function:

### `express.json()` Middleware in `app.use()`

In an Express.js application, `express.json()` is middleware that parses incoming requests with **JSON payloads** and makes the data available in `req.body`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Why Use `express.json()`?**

By default, Express **does not** parse JSON request bodies. When a client (e.g., frontend or API consumer) sends JSON data in a `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` request, you need `express.json()` to extract that JSON into a JavaScript object.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Usage Example**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON requests

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body); // Parsed JSON data
    res.send('Data received');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works**

1. A client sends a `POST` request with a JSON body:
    
    ```json
    {
       "name": "Alice",
       "age": 25
    }
    ```
    
2. **Without `express.json()`** â†’ `req.body` would be `undefined`.
3. **With `express.json()`** â†’ `req.body` will be:
    
    ```javascript
    { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }
    ```
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Key Points**

- Only parses `application/json` requests.
- Should be placed **before** route handlers to ensure parsing happens first.
- Automatically handles `Content-Type: application/json` headers.
- If JSON parsing fails, Express returns a `400 Bad Request` error.
