To be able to send **HTML** page to a server, we use html files instead of **.get(...)** blocks.

#### How to do it?
We need to create a directory in the main directory of the project and write html files here which represents each path which was represented in the previous lecture using **.get(..)** method.
We should also configure main code (js) to use this folder's files. So we need to write something like that:
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public');
// Setup static directory to serve

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server started in port 3000!')
});   
```

In **public** directory there are multiple **HTML** files which represents the paths.
