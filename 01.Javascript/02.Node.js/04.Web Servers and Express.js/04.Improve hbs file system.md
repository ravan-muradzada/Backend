You can learn more in the previous lecture about **hbs** files: [[03.Using hbs files instead of html]].
Sometimes we need to add the same functionalities to each page in our server and for that we copy-paste these features to each page's **hbs** files. 
However, there is a better way, so we can just create a sample file which contains these the same properties and then call it in the necessary **hbs** files. These files are called **partials**.

To implement that, we should divide **templates** directory to two subdirectories. One of them becomes **views** where there are standard **hbs** files and another one is called **partials** where we will create that kind of files.

```javascript
hbs.registerPartials(path.join(__dirname, '../templates/partials'))
```
We need to add this property to **main js file** to be able to use partials. (Of course, if we should import **hbs** package).

In **hbs** files, when we want to call the partials, we just need to use `{{ >partialFileName }}` and this makes them import.
