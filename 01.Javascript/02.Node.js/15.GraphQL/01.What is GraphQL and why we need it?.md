### **What is GraphQL?**

GraphQL is a **query language** for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, nothing more, nothing less.

### **Why Do We Need It?**

✅ **Flexible Queries** – Clients can fetch multiple resources in a **single request** (unlike REST, which requires multiple endpoints).  
✅ **Prevents Over-fetching & Under-fetching** – Only gets the requested data, improving performance.  
✅ **Strongly Typed Schema** – Ensures **structured and predictable API responses**.  
✅ **Real-time Data** – Supports **subscriptions** for real-time updates.
