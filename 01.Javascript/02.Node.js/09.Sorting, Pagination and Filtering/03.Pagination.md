Mostly, while fetching data and show them to user, we may want to paginate them, to skip some of them or to limit them and show just some on top. For that, we use two specific methods: `limit` and `skip`. We create them in `options` object like that:
```javascript
router.get('/tasks', auth, async (req, res) => {
    const match = {};

    if (req.query.completed) {
        match.completed = (req.query.completed === 'true');
    }
    try {
        const user = await req.user.populate({
            path: 'tasks',
            match,
            options: {
                limit: parseInt(req.query.limit),
                skip: parseInt(req.query.skip)
            }
        });

        res.send(user.tasks);
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(500).send(e);
    }
});
```

With another method, we can write it like that:
```javascript
router.get('/tasks', auth, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const tasks = await Task.find(
            {
                owner: req.user._id, 
                completed: (req.query.completed === 'true')
            })
            .limit(req.query.limit).skip(req.query.skip);

        res.send(tasks)
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(500).send(e);
    }
});
```
