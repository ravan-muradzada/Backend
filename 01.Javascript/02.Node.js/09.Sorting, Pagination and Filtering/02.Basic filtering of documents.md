Sometimes, we can need to filter the fetched data according to some parameters. Maybe we want to select them according to some functionalities. Such us, if a user have multiple tasks, however he wants to fetch ones which are not completed yet, we need to have a filtering system. We can use `match`field for this:
```javascript
router.get('/tasks', auth, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const user = await req.user.populate({
            path: 'tasks',
            match: {
                completed: false
            }
        });

        res.send(user.tasks);
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(500).send(e);
    }
});
```

We also can write it like that:
```javascript
router.get('/tasks', auth, async (req, res) => {
    const match = {};

    if (req.query.completed) {
        match.completed = (req.query.completed === 'true');
    }
    try {
        const user = await req.user.populate({
            path: 'tasks',
            match
        });

        res.send(user.tasks);
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(500).send(e);
    }
});
```
