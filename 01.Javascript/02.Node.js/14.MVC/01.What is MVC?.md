### **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Explained**

MVC is a **design pattern** used in software development to separate concerns, making applications more **organized, scalable, and maintainable**. It divides an application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model** â†’ Manages data & business logic
2. **View** â†’ Handles UI & presentation
3. **Controller** â†’ Acts as a bridge between Model and View

### ðŸ”¹ **How MVC Works**

4. **User interacts with the View (UI).**
5. **Controller receives the request** and processes it.
6. **Controller calls the Model** to fetch/update data.
7. **Model retrieves or updates data** in the database.
8. **Controller sends the data to the View.**
9. **View displays the updated data to the user.**

### ðŸ”¹ **Detailed Breakdown**

|Component|Role|
|---|---|
|**Model**|- Represents data & business logic- Interacts with the database (CRUD operations)- Example: User authentication logic, database queries|
|**View**|- Handles UI and displays data- Does **not** contain logic, only presentation- Example: HTML templates, frontend frameworks (React, EJS)|
|**Controller**|- Acts as a middleman between Model & View- Processes user requests and calls the right Model methods- Example: Express.js route handlers, Django views|

### ðŸ”¹ **Example: MVC in a Node.js + Express App**

ðŸ“Œ **Scenario:** A user wants to view their profile.

```plaintext
1. User visits `/profile`
2. Controller (`profileController.js`) handles the request
3. Controller asks Model (`User.js`) to get user data
4. Model fetches user info from the database
5. Controller sends data to View (`profile.ejs`)
6. View renders the profile page with user data
```

### ðŸ”¹ **Why Use MVC?**

âœ… **Separation of concerns** â†’ Easier maintenance  
âœ… **Scalability** â†’ Each component is independent  
âœ… **Reusability** â†’ Models and Views can be reused in different parts of the app  
âœ… **Improved debugging** â†’ Each layer is focused on a specific function
