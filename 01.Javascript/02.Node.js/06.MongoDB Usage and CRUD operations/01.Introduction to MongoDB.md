##### What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a **NoSQL database** designed for storing, managing, and retrieving large volumes of data. It is **document-oriented**, meaning it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of rows and columns (used in traditional relational databases).

- **Key Features:**
    1. **NoSQL Database**:
        - It is non-relational and schema-less, allowing for flexibility in data structure.
    2. **Document-Based**:
        - Data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, making it human-readable and easy to query.
    3. **Scalability**:
        - Supports horizontal scaling using sharding for large-scale applications.
    4. **High Performance**:
        - Optimized for read and write operations.
    5. **Flexibility**:
        - No fixed schema, so documents in a collection can have different fields.
    6. **Cross-Platform**:
        - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **When to Use MongoDB:**
    1. Applications that require high flexibility in data modeling.
    2. Projects with rapidly evolving requirements (e.g., startups).
    3. Handling large-scale data (big data) or distributed systems.
    4. Use cases like real-time analytics, IoT, and content management systems.

- **Basic Terminology:**
    1. **Database**: A container for collections.
    2. **Collection**: A group of documents (similar to a table in relational databases).
    3. **Document**: A single JSON-like object containing data (similar to a row in relational databases).
    4. **Field**: A key-value pair in a document (similar to a column in relational databases).
    5. **_id**: A unique identifier for every document in a collection.

- **Example of a Document in MongoDB**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "_id": "123abc",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 30,
      "skills": ["JavaScript", "Node.js", "MongoDB"],
      "isActive": true
    }
    ```

- **Strengths**:
    
    - Easy to use and set up.
    - Great for applications requiring frequent changes to the data schema.
    - High scalability and performance.
- **Limitations**:
    
    - Not ideal for applications with complex transactions.
    - Relational operations (like joins) are less efficient compared to relational databases.
