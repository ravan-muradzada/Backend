In MongoDB, **read operations** are used to retrieve data from the database. The most commonly used read operations include:

1. **find()**: This operation is used to read documents from a collection that match a specified query. It can be used with or without conditions, meaning you can either fetch all documents or filter them based on specific criteria.
    
2. **findOne()**: Similar to `find()`, but instead of returning all matching documents, it returns only the first matching document.
    
3. **countDocuments()**: This operation counts the number of documents in a collection that match a given query. It does not return the documents themselves, just the count.
    
4. **distinct()**: This operation retrieves distinct values for a specific field from the collection, meaning no duplicates.
    
5. **aggregate()**: A more powerful and flexible method that allows for complex queries and transformations on the documents in the collection. It can include filtering, grouping, sorting, and more.
    

#### Key Points:

- **Asynchronous**: MongoDB operations are usually asynchronous, meaning they don't block the program from continuing while they retrieve data.
- **Filtering**: You can specify conditions or criteria to filter the documents you want to retrieve.
- **Cursor**: The `find()` method returns a cursor, which can be used to iterate over the results. Methods like `toArray()` or `forEach()` are commonly used to process the results.

Overall, MongoDB provides various ways to read and query data, depending on the complexity of the request and the need for filtering, transformation, or aggregation of data.

#### Example Code:

`find(..)`:

```javascript
const readDocuments = async (connectionURL, query) => {
    try {   
        const client = await MongoClient.connect(connectionURL);

        const db = client.db(databaseName);

        // const users = await db.collection('users').find(query).toArray(); // If we want to keep it as array

        await db.collection('users').find(query).forEach(user => console.log(user));
        console.log('Successfully read!');
        client.close();
    } catch {
        console.log('Error happened!');
    }
}
```

`findOne(..)`:
```javascript
const readDocument = async (connectionURL, query) => {
    try {
        const client = await MongoClient.connect(connectionURL);

        const db = client.db(databaseName);

        const user = await db.collection('users').findOne(query);

        console.log('Successfully read! ', user)
        client.close();
    } catch {
        console.log('Error happened!');
    }
}
```

`countDocuments(..)`:
```javascript
const countDocuments = async (connectionURL, query) => {
    try {
        const client = await MongoClient.connect(connectionURL);

        const db = client.db(databaseName);

        const count = await db.collection('users').countDocuments(query);

        console.log('Successfully read! Document count: ', count);
        client.close();
    } catch {
        console.log('Error happened!');
    }
}
```
