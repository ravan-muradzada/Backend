In MongoDB, the **ObjectId** is a unique identifier used to identify documents in a collection. It is automatically created by MongoDB for each document when one is inserted without a specified `_id` field. Here's a brief overview of **ObjectId**:

### Key Characteristics of ObjectId:

1. **Uniqueness**:
    
    - An **ObjectId** is guaranteed to be unique across all collections, databases, and even servers.
    - It’s generated using several factors to ensure its uniqueness (timestamp, machine identifier, process identifier, and a counter).
2. **Structure**:
    
    - An **ObjectId** is a 12-byte identifier, usually represented as a 24-character hexadecimal string when shown in its string form.
        - **4 bytes** for the timestamp (seconds since Unix epoch).
        - **5 bytes** for a machine identifier.
        - **3 bytes** for a process ID.
        - **3 bytes** for a counter, initialized to a random value.
3. **Timestamp**:
    
    - The first 4 bytes of an **ObjectId** represent the creation time of the document. This allows you to extract the creation time directly from the **ObjectId** using MongoDB's `getTimestamp()` function.
4. **Usage**:
    
    - The **_id** field in a MongoDB document is typically an **ObjectId**, but you can use other types (e.g., string, integer) if needed.
    - It’s primarily used for uniquely identifying documents within a collection.
5. **Immutability**:
    
    - The **ObjectId** cannot be changed once it’s set for a document. It's a read-only field once the document is created.

### Summary:

- **ObjectId** is a 12-byte unique identifier automatically generated by MongoDB.
- It is used as the default **_id** for documents, providing both uniqueness and a timestamp of when the document was created.
- The **ObjectId** is efficient, lightweight, and enables easy identification and management of documents.
