CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete**. These are the four basic operations used to interact with a database and manage its data.

1. **Create**: Adds new data (records/documents) to the database.
    
    - Used to insert or save new information.
2. **Read**: Retrieves existing data from the database.
    
    - Allows you to query and view data.
3. **Update**: Modifies existing data in the database.
    
    - Used to make changes to specific records/documents.
4. **Delete**: Removes data from the database.
    
    - Deletes specific records/documents no longer needed.

### **Why Are CRUD Operations Important?**

- They represent the fundamental actions for managing data in any database system.
- CRUD ensures data is effectively created, maintained, and removed as needed.

These operations can be performed in both relational databases (SQL) and NoSQL databases (like MongoDB).
