In MongoDB, the **delete operations** are used to remove documents from a collection. These operations are essential for maintaining data hygiene and managing your database effectively. There are two primary types of delete operations:

1. **deleteOne**:
    
    - Removes a single document that matches the specified query.
    - If multiple documents match the query, only the first matching document (based on the collection's internal order) is deleted.
2. **deleteMany**:
    
    - Removes all documents that match the specified query.
    - This operation is useful when you need to clear a set of related documents.

### Key Notes:

- **Query Condition**: Both operations require a query to specify which documents to delete. Without a query, no documents will be deleted.
- **Irreversible Action**: Deleting documents is permanent; the data cannot be recovered unless backed up.
- **Efficient Use**: Always ensure you specify precise queries to avoid unintended deletions.

These operations are straightforward but should be handled carefully, especially in production environments, to prevent accidental data loss.

#### Example Code

`deleteOne(..)`:
```javascript
const deleteDocument = async (connectionURL, query) => {
    try {
        const client = await MongoClient.connect(connectionURL);

        const db = client.db(databaseName);

        await db.collection('users').deleteOne(query);

        client.close();
    } catch{
        console.log('Error happened!');
    }
}
```

`deleteMany(..)`:
```javascript
const deleteDocuments = async (connectionURL, query)=> {
    try {
        const client = await MongoClient.connect(connectionURL);

        const db = client.db(databaseName);

        await db.collection('users').deleteMany(query);

        console.log('Successfully deleted!');
        client.close();
    } catch{
        console.log('Error happened!');
    }
}
```
