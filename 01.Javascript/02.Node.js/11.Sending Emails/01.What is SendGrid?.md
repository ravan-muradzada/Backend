Think of it like this:  
You want to send emails, but instead of managing everything yourself (servers, spam issues, etc.), **SendGrid takes care of it for you**. You just tell it who to send the email to and what to include, and it does the rest!

It is like to send mails without needing to use email services like Gmail, Outlook and etc explicitly.
