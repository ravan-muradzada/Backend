### What Are Environment Variables (Env Vars)?

Environment variables (env vars) are a way to store configuration values outside your code. They can be used to manage settings like API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive or environment-specific information. By using environment variables, you can easily change configuration values without modifying the code itself, making it more flexible and secure.

### Why Use Environment Variables?

1. **Security**: Sensitive information like API keys or database passwords should never be hardcoded in the codebase. Environment variables allow you to store these securely outside your code.
2. **Configuration Flexibility**: Different environments (development, production, testing) may require different configurations. Using environment variables, you can change configurations without changing your code.
3. **Ease of Deployment**: Many cloud platforms and hosting services automatically handle environment variables, making deployment easier and more secure.

### How to Create and Use Environment Variables

#### 1. **Create a `.env` File**:

A `.env` file is a plain text file where you define your environment variables. This file is typically placed at the root of your project.

Example `.env` file:

```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=mrdzade15@gmail.com
PORT=3000
```

- Each line contains a key-value pair, where the key is the environment variable name (e.g., `SENDGRID_API_KEY`) and the value is the value you want to assign to it (e.g., `your_sendgrid_api_key_here`).

#### 2. **Install `dotenv` Package (for Node.js)**:

In Node.js, you can use the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file into your application.

To install `dotenv`, run:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

#### 3. **Load the `.env` File in Your Code**:

To use the environment variables defined in the `.env` file, you need to load them in your application. You can do this by calling `dotenv.config()`.

In your `app.js` (or the main entry file), add the following line at the top:

```js
require('dotenv').config({ path: './config/dev.env' });
```

#### 4. **Access Environment Variables**:

Once the `.env` file is loaded, you can access the environment variables in your code using `process.env.<VARIABLE_NAME>`.

For example, if you have a `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in your `.env` file, you can access it like this:

```js
const sendgridApiKey = process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY;
console.log(sendgridApiKey);
```

#### 5. **Avoid Committing `.env` File**:

Since the `.env` file may contain sensitive information (like API keys), it’s important not to commit it to version control (e.g., Git). Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being pushed to a repository.

In your `.gitignore` file, add:

```
.env
```

### Example Project Setup

1. **Project Structure**:
    
    ```
    my-project/
    ├── config/
    │   └── .env
    ├── node_modules/
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── app.js
    └── package.json
    ```
    
2. **.env File**:
    
    ```env
    SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
    FROM_EMAIL=mrdzade15@gmail.com
    PORT=3000
    ```
    
3. **app.js (Main File)**:
    
    ```js
    require('dotenv').config({ path: './config/dev.env' });  // Load .env file
    
    const sendgridApiKey = process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY;
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;  // Default to 3000 if PORT is not set
    
    console.log(`SendGrid API Key: ${sendgridApiKey}`);
    console.log(`App will run on port ${port}`);
    ```
    

### Summary:

- **Environment Variables** store sensitive information or configuration values outside your code.
- **`.env` File** is a simple text file where you define these variables in a key-value format.
- Use the **`dotenv` package** to load variables from the `.env` file into your application.
- **Access** them using `process.env.<VARIABLE_NAME>`.
