First, we need to sign up in SendGrid website. Then we need to get API key which we will use in our application. 

#### How to get API key?
We should go to Settings > API Keys > Create API Key > Full Access. Here we need to give a name to API and then click **Click & View**.
Then, we will our new API Key and now it is time to copy and use it. (Remember it, we will use it in javascript).

#### Sender Authentication
We should also authenticate the sender. We should click on it and then select *Single Sender Verification > Verify a Single Sender*. Here we will create a sender and receiver and add some information. Then it  will send a verification message to sender email and he should verify it.

#### Time to Code
To be able to use SendGrid, we should download a specific npm module for the project:
```bash
npm i @sendgrid/mail@latest
```
It is better to create a folder in `src` folder named `emails` and files here. I give `account.js` name to this file and write the code there:

```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail')
const sendgridAPIKEY = 'private';

sgMail.setApiKey(sendgridAPIKEY);

sgMail.send({
    to: 'mrdzade15@gmail.com',
    from: 'mrdzade15@gmail.com',
    subject: 'This is my first creation!',
    text: 'bullshit'
})
.then(() => console.log('Send successfully!'))
.catch(e => console.log('Error occurred!'));
```
As you can see, we need to set copied api key (from the website) and using `send` method, we can easily send our emails.

If we run this file, the message will be send
