In  the previos lesson, we have learned how to handle with SendGrid and send messages from the code. [[02.How to use SendGrid?|How to use SendGrid?]]
Now, it is time to connect it with our application's code.
Mostly, we need send a message to a user when he registers and log outs. So we need to create two functions for each in accounts file in emails folder.
```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail')
const sendgridAPIKEY = 'private';

sgMail.setApiKey(sendgridAPIKEY);

const sendWelcomeEmail = (email, name) => {
    sgMail.send({
        to: email,
        from: 'mrdzade15@gmail.com',
        subject: 'Thanks for joining us!',
        text: `Welcome to the app, ${name}. Let me know how you get along with the app.`
    });
}

const sendGoodByeEmail = (email, name) => {
    sgMail.send({
        to: email,
        from: 'mrdzade15@gmail.com',
        subject: 'GoodBye!',
        text: `Thanks ${name}, for using us for a while!`
    });
}

module.exports = {
    sendWelcomeEmail,
    sendGoodByeEmail
}
```

**Usage in Registering and Logging out part:**

```javascript
const { sendWelcomeEmail, sendGoodByeEmail } = require('../emails/account');

router.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
    const user = new User(req.body);

    try{        
        const token = await user.generateToken();
        sendWelcomeEmail(user.email, user.name);
        await user.save();

        res.send({user, token});
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(400).send(e)
    }
});

router.delete('/users/me', auth, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        sendGoodByeEmail(req.user.email, req.user.name);
        await req.user.deleteOne();
        res.send(req.user);
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(500).send(e);
    } 
});
```
