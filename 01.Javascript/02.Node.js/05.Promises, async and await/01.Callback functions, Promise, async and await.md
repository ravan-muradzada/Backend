#### **1. What are Callback Functions?**

A **callback function** is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. This allows you to run code after an operation (like reading a file or making an API request) has completed.

### **Example of Callback Function:**

Imagine you have a function that simulates fetching data from a server. It uses a callback to process the data after it's fetched:

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  // Simulating a data fetch with setTimeout
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = "Here is your data!";
    callback(data);  // Calls the callback function after 2 seconds
  }, 2000);
}

// Using the callback function
fetchData(function(data) {
  console.log(data);  // Logs "Here is your data!" after 2 seconds
});
```

Here:

- `fetchData` simulates an asynchronous operation (like fetching data).
- Once the data is fetched (after 2 seconds), it calls the provided callback function with the data as an argument.
- The callback then logs the result.

#### **Why Do We Need Promises?**

While callback functions work, they can become **hard to manage** when you have many asynchronous operations that depend on each other. This is called **callback hell**, and it can make your code messy and difficult to read.

### **Example of Callback Hell:**

Imagine you have a situation where you need to fetch data from one server, process it, and then make another request based on that data:

```javascript
fetchData(function(data) {
  console.log("First data:", data);
  
  // Fetch more data based on the first
  fetchData(function(secondData) {
    console.log("Second data:", secondData);
    
    // Do something with the second data
    fetchData(function(thirdData) {
      console.log("Third data:", thirdData);
    });
  });
});
```

This is hard to follow, and if you had many more levels of nesting, it would become even worse.

#### **Enter Promises:**

Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations that improves readability. A **Promise** represents a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never.

### **Using Promises to Improve the Code:**

Here’s how the previous example would look with Promises:

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Here is your data!";
      resolve(data);  // Resolves the promise with the data
    }, 2000);
  });
}

// Using Promises
fetchData().then(data => {
  console.log("First data:", data);

  return fetchData();  // Chain another fetch
}).then(secondData => {
  console.log("Second data:", secondData);

  return fetchData();  // Chain another fetch
}).then(thirdData => {
  console.log("Third data:", thirdData);
}).catch(error => {
  console.log("Error:", error);  // Handle any errors
});
```

In this example:

- We use `fetchData()` which returns a **Promise**.
- We use `.then()` to handle the result after the Promise is resolved.
- The `.catch()` at the end is used to handle errors.

#### **What is Async/Await?**

**`async`** and **`await`** are a cleaner, more readable way to work with Promises. They allow you to write asynchronous code as if it were synchronous.

- **`async`**: Declares a function that returns a **Promise**.
- **`await`**: Pauses the function execution until the Promise is resolved and returns the result.

### **Using `async`/`await` for Cleaner Code:**

Here’s how the same code looks with `async` and `await`:

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Here is your data!";
      resolve(data);  // Resolves the promise with the data
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function fetchAllData() {
  try {
    const firstData = await fetchData();
    console.log("First data:", firstData);

    const secondData = await fetchData();
    console.log("Second data:", secondData);

    const thirdData = await fetchData();
    console.log("Third data:", thirdData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error:", error);  // Handles any errors
  }
}

fetchAllData();
```

In this version:

- We use **`await`** to pause the execution until each `fetchData()` Promise resolves.
- The code looks cleaner and is easier to read.
- We handle errors using a `try`/`catch` block, just like in synchronous code.

### **Key Questions:**

#### 1. **Do we need to have a function that returns a Promise to use `async/await`?**

Yes! In order to use **`await`**, you need to have a function that returns a **Promise**. If you use `await` on a non-Promise value, it will automatically wrap it in a resolved Promise.

For example:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  return "Hello, world!";  // This will be wrapped in a resolved Promise automatically
}

async function fetchData() {
  let data = await getData();
  console.log(data);  // "Hello, world!"
}
```

#### 2. **Do we need to always use `async` with `await`?**

Yes, **`await`** only works inside an **`async`** function. If you try to use `await` outside of an `async` function, you will get an error.

### **Summary of All Approaches:**

- **Callback Function:**
    
    - Passes a function to another function and is called after the operation is done.
    - Can lead to "callback hell" when there are multiple nested callbacks.
- **Promise (with `.then()` and `.catch()`):**
    
    - Handles asynchronous operations more cleanly than callbacks.
    - Returns a value wrapped in a Promise.
    - Handles success and errors using `.then()` and `.catch()`.
- **Async/Await:**
    
    - Makes asynchronous code look synchronous, improving readability.
    - Requires a function that returns a Promise.
    - Uses **`async`** to declare a function and **`await`** to wait for the Promise to resolve.

### **Final Example:**

Here’s a quick recap with all methods to fetch data:

#### Using Callback:

```javascript
fetchData(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

#### Using Promises:

```javascript
fetchData().then(data => {
  console.log(data);
}).catch(error => {
  console.log("Error:", error);
});
```

#### Using Async/Await:

```javascript
async function fetchAllData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error:", error);
  }
}
fetchAllData();
```

This should help you understand how each method works and when to use **Promises** or **Async/Await**.
