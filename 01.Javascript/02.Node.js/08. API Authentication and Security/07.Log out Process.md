While working any software account, we may need to log out sometimes and after that we should not have access to reading our data and interract with them (until we log in again). When we log out, also our current token should be deleted.
To do that we can create a special method:

```javascript
router.post('/users/logout', auth, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const currentToken = req.token;

        req.user.tokens = req.user.tokens.filter(t => t.token ==! currentToken);

        await req.user.save();
        res.status(201).send('Log outed!');
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(500).send(e);
    }
});
```

As you can see, I use `req.token` to get our current token. To be able to have access it here, we need to add a line to our middleware:

```javascript
const auth = async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const token = req.header('Authorization').replace('Bearer ', ''); 
        const payload = jwt.verify(token, 'thisIsMyNewCourse');
        const user = await User.findOne({_id: payload._id, 'tokens.token': token});

        if (!user){
            throw new Error('User not found!');
        }
        req.token = token; // This is an added line.
        req.user = user;
        next();
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(401).send({ error: 'Please, authenticate!'});
    }
}
```
To get more information about this middleware, look at:

Moreover, we can want to log out from all devices which we logged in with. We can create a simple method for that:
```javascript
router.post('/users/logout_all', auth, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        req.user.tokens = [];
        await req.user.save();

        res.status(201).send('All log outed!');
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(500).send(e);
    }
});
```
