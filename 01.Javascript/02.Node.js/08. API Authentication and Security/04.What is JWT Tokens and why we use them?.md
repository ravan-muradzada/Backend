Imagine a server which contains multiple pages, like it have *login* page, *createTask* page, *readYourTasks* page and etc and all of these need authentication (logging in successfully). As the first choice, just before to use each page in the server, we need to log in again and again. That is not good choice, and in real life we just need to log in once, mostly in *login* page and it the process is successfull, we can go the other pages without logging in manually each time. In real-time senarios, we have an expire time and up to this time, we do not need log in, however after it we should log in again.

#### How to log in just once in a time period?
To be able to do it, after the first time logging in *login* page, we can give the user an unique *id* and save it in server and each page in server should have an access to this id. We also send this id to the user himself. Each time user logs in, he needs to use his id and in the server's pages this *id* should be checked and if true, logging in will not  be required. 
It is a good way, however it has some drawbacks. One of them is we shouldn't load the server with that kind of data of multiple users. It will create a mess in the server. 
That is why, this method is not very good choice.

#### How to improve our method?
Instead of this method, we can use **JWT Tokens**. Let's learn how the process is going on if we use them:

1. In the first time (in logging page), user enters his credentials (like username and password).
2. Server checks them using the database and verify that this credentials are valid.
3. Server generates a **JWT Token**:
	- The server first created **headers** (e.g., `{"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT"}`) and encodes it to **Base64**. There the specific algorithm is selected.
	- Then the server created payload which is created from the credentials of the user (e.g., `{"id": 123, "role": "admin", "exp": <expiry timestamp>}`) and encodes it to **Base64**.
	-  The server combines the **Base64-encoded header** and **payload** with a `.` separator.
	- The server applies the algorithm specified in the header (e.g., `HS256`) and uses a **secret key** to generate a **signature**.
	- Example Signature Generation: 	
		`HMAC_SHA256(Base64Header + "." + Base64Payload, secretKey`
	- The server sends this data to client and the client saves it. Full token is:
		`Base64Header.Base64Payload.Signature`
	- In subsequent requests, the client each time sends this token to the pages of the server and the server checks it. The server takes the `Base64Header.Base64Payload` part from the token and implements the same algorithm on this and if the result is the same with the `Signature` from incoming token, that  means everything is ok and he can enter the pages. Note that, in this cases there is also an expiration time (it is mentioned payload part of the token) and after this time, the user should log in again.

#### Implementation in Javascript
Javascript offers us a specific library to be able to create and use **JWT Web Tokens**. We need to download its npm module named `jsonwebtoken`. It has two main methods:
- `sign()` - It is used while logging in, in this part the token is created.
- `verify()` - It is used when we needs to enter the other pages after successfully logging in and get our token. This is verifying method.

When using the `sign()` and `verify()` methods in JWT (with the `jsonwebtoken` library), here are the main parameters for each:

---

### **1. `sign()` Method** (Creating a JWT)

The `sign()` method is used to **generate a JWT**. Here are the key parameters:

#### **Parameters**:

1. **`payload`**: The **data** that you want to include in the token. This could be information like user ID, username, email, etc. The payload is **not encrypted**, but it is signed.
    
    - Example: `{ userId: 123, username: 'john_doe' }`
2. **`secretOrPrivateKey`**: The **secret key** or **private key** used to **sign** the token. This key should be kept **secure** (never hardcoded in the code for production).
    
    - Example: `'secret_key'` (or use a more secure method like environment variables for storing it).
3. **`options`** (optional): An object containing options to control how the token is generated.
    
    - Common options include:
        - **`expiresIn`**: Specifies the expiration time of the token (e.g., `'1h'`, `'30m'`, `'1d'`).
        - **`issuer`**: Identifies the issuer of the token.
        - **`audience`**: Identifies the intended audience of the token.
        - **`algorithm`**: Specifies which algorithm to use for signing the token (e.g., `HS256`, `RS256`).
        - **`noTimestamp`**: If set to `true`, it prevents adding a timestamp (`iat`) to the token.

#### **Example**:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const payload = { userId: 123, username: 'john_doe' };
const secretKey = 'your_secret_key';

// Create a JWT with a 1-hour expiration time
const token = jwt.sign(payload, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });

console.log(token);  // Send this token to the client
```

---

### **2. `verify()` Method** (Verifying a JWT)

The `verify()` method is used to **validate a JWT**. Here are the key parameters:

#### **Parameters**:

1. **`token`**: The **JWT** to be verified. This is typically received from the client (e.g., from the `Authorization` header).
    
    - Example: `'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyMywidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJqb2huX2RvZSIsImlhdCI6MTYyMjM4MjMwMSwiZXhwIjoxNjIyMzg1MTAxfQ.Jb1z8bwD6Pt6IEiF_xV4W_G0k25d_Psd9Qrk_Qb2-qI'`
2. **`secretOrPublicKey`**: The **secret key** or **public key** used to verify the token. This should match the key used to sign the token.
    
    - Example: `'your_secret_key'` (for symmetric algorithms like `HS256`).
    - If you're using an asymmetric algorithm (like `RS256`), this would be your public key.
3. **`options`** (optional): An object containing options to control how the token is verified.
    
    - Common options include:
        - **`issuer`**: The expected issuer of the token.
        - **`audience`**: The expected audience of the token.
        - **`clockTolerance`**: The tolerance allowed when checking the tokenâ€™s expiration time (`exp`).
        - **`clockTimestamp`**: Allows you to specify the time to check expiration against, useful when doing tests.

#### **Example**:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const token = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyMywidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJqb2huX2RvZSIsImlhdCI6MTYyMjM4MjMwMSwiZXhwIjoxNjIyMzg1MTAxfQ.Jb1z8bwD6Pt6IEiF_xV4W_G0k25d_Psd9Qrk_Qb2-qI';
const secretKey = 'your_secret_key';

try {
  // Verify the token
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, secretKey);
  console.log('Token is valid:', decoded);
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Invalid token:', err.message);
}
```
