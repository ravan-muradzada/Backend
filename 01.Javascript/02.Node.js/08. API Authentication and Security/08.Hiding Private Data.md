When we need to send data to browser from the server, we may want to send all data especially like password or tokens array. To prevent that we can create a method in its model file. This method should work for each object individually, so thus we use **methods** keyword. We need to give it only this name: `toJSON`.
```javascript
userSchema.methods.toJSON = function () {
    const  user = this.toObject();

	// Removing all data which should not be sent to the client
    delete user.password;
    delete user.tokens;
    
    return user;
}
```
We do not  need to make changes in routers files, so the users automatically will be updated before sent to the client.
