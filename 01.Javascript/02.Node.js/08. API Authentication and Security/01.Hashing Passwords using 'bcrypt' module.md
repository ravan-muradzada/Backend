In real world, databases especially ones keeps users' valuable data like passwords often are attacked by hackers and because of that is not a good idea to keep passwords as a plain text in database. We must hash them and if the hacker can get the database's data, he can just see hashed passwords which are not convertible.

#### What is Hashing?
**Hashing** is a process used to convert data (like a password or a file) into a fixed-size string of characters, which represents the original data. The output is called a **hash**. Here's an overview:

### Characteristics of Hashing:

1. **One-Way Function**:  
    Hashing is irreversible; you can't retrieve the original data from the hash. This is why it's used for passwords.
    
2. **Fixed-Length Output**:  
    Regardless of the size of the input data, the hash is always the same length. For example:
    
    - "hello" → `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592` (MD5)
    - "hello world" → `fc3ff98e8c6a0d3087d515c0473f8677` (MD5)
3. **Deterministic**:  
    The same input will always produce the same hash.
    
4. **Avalanche Effect**:  
    A small change in the input drastically changes the hash:
    
    - "hello" → `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592`
    - "Hello" → `8b1a9953c4611296a827abf8c47804d7`
5. **Collision-Resistant**:  
    A good hashing algorithm ensures that two different inputs don’t produce the same hash (no collisions).

### Common Uses of Hashing:

1. **Password Storage**:  
    Passwords are hashed before being stored in a database. Even if the database is hacked, the original passwords can't be seen.
    
2. **Data Integrity**:  
    Hashes can verify if a file or message has been tampered with by comparing its hash to a known value.
    
3. **Digital Signatures and Certificates**:  
    Hashing ensures data authenticity and integrity in digital communications.

### Hashing Algorithms:

- **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)**: SHA-256, SHA-3 (commonly used for general hashing).
- **MD5**: Now considered weak; avoid for secure applications.
- **bcrypt, Argon2**: Designed specifically for password hashing with added security features.

### Example (Hashing a Password with SHA-256):

Input: "mypassword"  
Output: `5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbddfcf1d6f2e6d5bf1a4`

In Javascript, we can use `bcrypt` module to hash the passwords. We should download it using npm.

In the bcrypt, there are two main methods:
- `hash(password, count)`: The first parameter is the password which we want to hash and the second parameter is the number of times the hashing algorithm should be executed on the password. The best value is **8**, fewer counts are not very safe and more counts can take a lot of time.
- `compare(password, hashedPassword)`: As the first parameter, we should send the plain password and the second one is beforehand hashed password and the method checks whether the second one is a hashed version of the plain password or not. To do that, the first parameter (plain password) is hashed and compared with the second parameter.
