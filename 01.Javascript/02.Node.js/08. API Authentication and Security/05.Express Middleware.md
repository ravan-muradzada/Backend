Sometimes, when the request comes from the browser to our server, we need to check it before it reaches to the server. Such us, we can chekc whethere it uses **HTTP** or **HTTPS** and allow only the second one or other things like that.
To be able to do something on the requests like that we need to use middlewares.
When we create a middleware, we use `app.use(...)` method:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (req.method === 'GET'){
        res.status(400).send('We do not accept GET requests now!');
    }else{
        next();
    }
});
```

We can create it in index.js and in this case we created a middleware for all routes. However, if we want to create one for the specific router, we should write its code in router's page. 
If we do not allow the request to go to the server, we should send it back to the client (browser), otherwise using `next()` method we send it to the server.

However, it is better to create a directory named **middleware** (inside src folder) where the middleware files are found.
