Let's talk how can we implement hashing process on the code. Hashing process should be just before saving the password to database. So we need something which is executed just before `save()` method of `mongoose`. 

#### Schema and Model
For these cases, it is better to create a schema before creating a model.

```javascript
const userSchema = mongoose.Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true,
        lowercase: true,
        validate(value) {
            if (!validator.isEmail(value)){
                throw new Error('Email is invalid!');
            }
        }
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true,
        minlength: 7,
        validate(value){
            if (value.toLowerCase().includes('password')) {
                throw new Error('Password invalid!');
            }
        }
    },
    age: {
        type: Number,
        default: 0,
        validate(value) {
            if (value < 0){
                throw new Error('Age should be more than 0!');
            }
        }
    }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

#### Middlewares
Now, we can method the specific method which can be executed before `save()` method and we have ones in `schema` and that is called **middleware**. 
The main **middlewares** are ***pre*** and ***post***. So ***pre*** is executed before the specificed method (like `save`) and ***post*** just does it after.
You can get more and specified information about middlewares and usages in **Mongoose Documents/Middleware**.

Of course, in our case we need ***pre*** middleware. To be able to use it, we should write its code between creating schema and creating model. 
```javascript
userSchema.pre('save', async function(next) {
    const user = this;

    if (user.isModified('password')) {
        user.password = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, 8);
    }
    
    next();
});
```
The second argument (function) should be written as traditionally using `function` keyword, we do not use `() =>`, because while using it, we cannot use `this` method. `this` is belongs to the document which will be saved. 
We just need to hash the password when the user is created or wants to change his password and thas is why, we use `isModified(..)` method to check whether the password is created or changed. If yes, the hashing is done, otherwise no.

#### Issue in Updating and Solution
In the **REST APi** methods where `save()` is used, the middleware (`pre`) is executed, and while creating a new user, that is used. However, when we update user information, we do not specifically `save()` method to save changes. Instead, we prefer the methods like `findByIdAndUpdate(...)`.
However, our middleware will not work in this case, so we need to make some changes in our code and use specifically `save()` method.

```javascript
router.patch('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
    const updates = Object.keys(req.body);
    const allowedUpdates = ['name', 'email', 'password', 'age'];
    const isValidUpdate = updates.every(update => allowedUpdates.includes(update));

    if (!isValidUpdate)
        return res.status(400).send({error: 'Invalid Operation!'});


    try {
		// Changed part
        const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);
        updates.forEach(update => user[update] = req.body[update]);
        await user.save();
		// Up to here
		
        if (!user) {
            return res.status(404).send();
        }

        res.send(user);
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(400).send(e);
    }
});
```
For the previous version of the code, look at: [[08.Resource Updating Endpoint|Resource Updating Endpoint]].

As you can see, we just take the user as object in `user` variable and changes its specificed values using `forEach` according to user input (`req.body`) and then save it using `save()` method.
