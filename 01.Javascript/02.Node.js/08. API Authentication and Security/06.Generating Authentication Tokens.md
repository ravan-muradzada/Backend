In this lecture, let's talk about generating **JWT** and usage of it. 

#### Cases when a token need to be generated.
From real life senarios, we  can say there are two main time when we need to generate a token:
- When new user is added (registered), he has automatically logged in and thus a token should be generated.
- When any user logs in their account.

#### Creating and Saving Tokens
We use post method when we create (register) a new user or log in: `router.post(...)`. Inside it, we write the code to create a new user with the given credentials and save in database or log in. In addition to them, we also should generate token for this user. Each new user should have their own token and thus we need to have a specific method which can work for each individual user. We do not have a build-in method for this, thus we should create it. Schemas let us to create specific methods which work individually for all users.
`userSchema.methods.generateToken = async function(){...}`
We create this function in the model file for the user.
Moreover, our schema for users needs to have a collection which holds its tokens and thus we need to add this to our schema:
```javascript
tokens: [{
        token: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        }
    }]
```

In `generateMethod` method, we can write:
```javascript
userSchema.methods.generateToken = async function() {
    const user = this;
    const privateKey = 'thisIsMyNewCourse';
    const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id.toString()}, privateKey);

    user.tokens = user.tokens.concat({ token }); 
    // Pushing new token to tokens array

    await user.save();

    return token;
}
```
While signing for the token, we need to add its unique parameter which is id which is created automatically by **MongoDB** and it is shown with `_id`.

#### Registering Process
In registering (creating new user) process, we need to generate user-specific token, too.
```javascript
// Creating a new user
router.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
    const user = new User(req.body);

    try{
        await user.save();
        
        const token = await user.generateToken();

        res.send(user);
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(400).send(e)
    }
});
```

#### Login Process
The process is too similar in login process, after finding a user appropriate to the given credentials, we should generate and save a new token for him:
```javascript
router.post('/users/login', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const user = await User.findByCredentials(req.body.email, req.body.password);
        const token = await user.generateToken();
        
        res.send(user);
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(400).send(e);
    }
});
```

#### Authorization Middleware
You have already know that we should use `verify` method for tokens in each page after logging  in. Instead of writing it each time in each method, we can create a middleware and then use it in the methods which needs to verify tokens. Because of that, we create a folder inside **src** named **middleware** and create a file named *auth.js* inside it.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const User = require('../models/user');

const auth = async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const token = req.header('Authorization').replace('Bearer ', ''); 
		// Most times we write `Bearer` to beginning of the header to understand that is token. Now we ignore it.

        const payload = jwt.verify(token, 'thisIsMyNewCourse');
		// Find payload from jwt

        const user = await User.findOne({_id: payload._id, 'tokens.token': token}); // Find the user in db with the information from payload.

        if (!user){
            throw new Error('User not found!');
        }

        req.user = user; // To save user in request parameter to use after.
        next();
    } catch(e) {
        res.status(401).send({ error: 'Please, authenticate!'});
    }
}

module.exports = auth;
```

In a route page, we need to import it: `const auth = require('../middleware/auth');`
and use it like: `router.get('/users/me', auth, async (req, res) => {} )`
#### User Profiles
From the early examples, you have already known that  we have created a specific GET method which sends all the data about all users to the client. However, in real life it is not logical for any client to be able to see information of all the users. Thus we can modify it to **user profiles**. So whenever the client send the request to this link, he can see only his own information.
```javascript
// Changed from /users to /users/me.
router.get('/users/me', auth, async (req, res) => {
	// In middleware, we saved user in req variable like (req.user = user)
	// Now it is time to use it.
    res.send(req.user);
});
```
Now after verifying the user in middleware, we can send his data.


#### How to send token from client?
In Postman, in headers part, we create a new header and give it a key name as **Authorization** and to its value we write:
*'Bearer ' + token*

However, it has a better way:
In both login and register (creating user) pages, we need to go to **Scripts > Post-response** and this code spinnet for each:
```javascript
if (pm.response.code === 201) {
    pm.environment.set('authToken', pm.response.json().token);
}
```
