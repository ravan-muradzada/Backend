### Broadcasting Events
You have already know that `socket.emit(..)` method sends the data to a specific user. There is another way of it. So we can send datat each user except the specific one using `socket.broadcast.emit(..)` method. 
We may want it when a new user connects to the app. In this case, all the users in the app except the new one will get a message: *A new user connected!*. The new user does not need to see this, because he is just one who connects newly.

### Disconnecting
We have already know about default method: `connection`, now it  is time to learn about `disconnect` which is called whenever any user disconnected from the app. We can use it to send messages. Explicitly, we do not need to handle it in chat.js.

---
### Example Code
```javascript
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    socket.emit('message', 'Welcome');
    socket.broadcast.emit('message', 'A new user connected!');

    socket.on('sendMessage', (message) => {
        io.emit('message', message);
    });

    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        io.emit('message', 'A user has left!')
    });
});
```
