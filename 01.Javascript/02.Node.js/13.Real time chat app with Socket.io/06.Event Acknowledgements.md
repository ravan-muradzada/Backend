Event Acknowledgements are the specific method which we use to be sure whether our request reaches to the wished location or not while using `socket.io`.
The process is like that; We need to create a callback function in `.emit` method which is called if only if the message reaches the wished location. This callback function should become always the last argument in `emit` method.
```javascript
socket.emit('sendMessage', message, () => {
    console.log('Message delivered!')
})
```
That is a way to create a acknowladge function in `emit` statement.

Let's understand how to handle it from `on` method:
```javascript
socket.on('sendMessage', (message, callback) => {
    io.emit('message', message)
    callback()
})
```
As you can see, the function inside `on` method takes both the other arguments comes from `emit` and also callback function (as the last argument).
