We can simply create a new button in our frront-end page using html file to send our current location. So when we click the button, it should automatically determine our location and then send it to google maps and send its url link.

Let's create html file first:
```javascript
<button id="share-location">Share Your Location</button>
```

<br>

Now, it is time to handle it in chat.js. Mostly, in chat.js there is a default function already for this functionality.
```js
document.querySelector('#share-location').addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (!navigator.geolocation) {
        console.log('Your browser does not support geolocation!');
        // Some browsers may not support this functionality.
    }

    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
        console.log(position); // To print location in console.
        socket.emit('sendLocation', position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude)
    });
});
```
<br>
After getting the valid location, we can handle it in index.js. Basically, we can create a link which can be clickable. From the console, we can click it and go the google maps.

```js
socket.on('sendLocation', (latitude, longitude) => {
    io.emit('message', `https://google.com/maps?q=${latitude},${longitude}`);
});
```

<br>
After that, we can basically click the button and then our location will be found and send us a link for google maps where our location is shown.
