Asynchronous code involves operations that execute independently of the main program flow, such as fetching data, working with timers, or handling user events. Testing asynchronous behavior ensures the code behaves as expected once the async tasks complete.

Jest provides built-in support for testing asynchronous code using several patterns, such as **callbacks**, **promises**, and **async/await**.

### Key Techniques for Testing Asynchronous Code in Jest

1. **Using the `done` Callback**

The `done` callback tells Jest to wait until the asynchronous operation completes before marking the test as finished. This is helpful for older async patterns, like `setTimeout` or APIs that use callbacks.

Example:

```javascript
test('Async test with done callback', (done) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        expect(22).toBe(22);
        done(); // Notify Jest that the test is complete
    }, 2000);
});
```

- Without the `done` callback, Jest might finish the test prematurely and miss the assertion.

2. **Using Promises**

Jest can natively handle promises. Simply return the promise, and Jest will wait for it to resolve or reject.

Example:

```javascript
test('Async test with promises', () => {
    const fetchData = () => Promise.resolve('data');
    return fetchData().then((data) => {
        expect(data).toBe('data');
    });
});
```

- If the promise is rejected and the error is unhandled, the test will fail automatically.

---

3. **Using `async/await`**

The `async/await` syntax provides a modern and cleaner approach to testing asynchronous code.

Example:

```javascript
const wait = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

test('Async test with async/await', async () => {
    await wait(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds
    expect(22).toBe(22);
});
```

- This is the preferred method for testing async code because it is more readable and avoids callback nesting.

4. **Testing Asynchronous Errors**

When testing for errors in asynchronous code, make sure the promise is properly handled or that the error is awaited.

Using Promises:

```javascript
test('Async error test with promises', () => {
    const fetchData = () => Promise.reject('error');
    return fetchData().catch((err) => {
        expect(err).toBe('error');
    });
});
```

Using `async/await`:

```javascript
test('Async error test with async/await', async () => {
    // Imagine, this is an important function from another file
    const fetchData = () => Promise.reject('error'); 
    
    await expect(fetchData()).rejects.toBe('error');
});
```

### Tips for Testing Asynchronous Code

1. **Avoid Using Arbitrary Delays**  
    Instead of hardcoding delays (e.g., `setTimeout`), use utilities like `jest.useFakeTimers()` or mock specific async behaviors to make tests faster and more predictable.
    
2. **Ensure Test Completeness**  
    Always ensure that asynchronous tests reach their completion point, whether by resolving promises or invoking the `done` callback.
    
3. **Handle Unhandled Rejections**  
    Jest will fail tests with unhandled promise rejections, so handle them explicitly using `.catch` or `rejects`.
    
4. **Mock External Dependencies**  
    When testing asynchronous code that relies on external APIs, use libraries like `jest.fn()` or `jest-mock` to simulate the API behavior.
