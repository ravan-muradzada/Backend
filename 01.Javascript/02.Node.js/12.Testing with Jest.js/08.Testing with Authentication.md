In the previos lesson, we write the code for testing logging in and signing up process:
[[07.Basic tests with Supertest|Basic tests with Supertest]]
While these process, our program does not need an authentication middleware and token (The token will be created after login and sign up processes).
However, when we check other processes like deleting the user from db, we will need to have a token. As you know, we use default user to make process on it.
```javascript
const userOne = {
    name: 'Example',
    email: 'example@gmail.com',
    password: 'examplePass_1234',
};

beforeEach(async () => {
    await User.deleteMany();
    await new User(userOne).save();
});
```
After each test, the user is deleted and recreated. So as you can see while creating it, we do not create a token for it and thus it can't work while deleting method.
We just need to create a token manually like that:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userOneId = new mongoose.Types.ObjectId();
const userOne = {
    _id: userOneId,
    name: 'Example',
    email: 'example@gmail.com',
    password: 'examplePass_1234',
    tokens: [{
        token: jwt.sign({ _id: userOneId }, process.env.SECRET_KEY)
    }]
};

beforeEach(async () => {
    await User.deleteMany();
    await new User(userOne).save();
});
```

Then we can create deleting tests, however there is again a problem, so we should specify this token to request using a specific method called `set(..)`.
```javascript
test('Should delete account for user', async () => {
    await request(app).delete('/users/me')
    .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${userOne.tokens[0].token}`)
    .send()
    .expect(200);
});
```

That is true version of deleting test, without `set` method, this will not work, because before reaching database, in the middleware its token is checked, so we should send it with the token.

Let's create another testcase which sends an error status code when the token is not specified in the request:
```javascript
test('Should not delete account for user', async () => {
    await request(app).delete('/users/me')
    .send()
    .expect(401);
});
```
