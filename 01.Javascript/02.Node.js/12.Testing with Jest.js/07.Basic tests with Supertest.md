Let's learn testing on the example:
```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../src/app');
const User = require('../src/models/user');

const userOne = {
    name: 'Example',
    email: 'example@gmail.com',
    password: 'examplePass_1234',
    plain: 'examplePass_1234'
};

beforeEach(async () => {
    await User.deleteMany();
    await new User(userOne).save();
});

test('Should create a new user', async () => {
    await request(app).post('/users')
    .send({
        name: 'Ravan2345',
        email: 'ravan123@gmail.com',
        password: 'fsgmyPass12345'
    }).expect(201);
});

test('Should login existing user', async () => {
    await request(app).post('/users/login').send({
        email: userOne.email,
        password: userOne.password
    }).expect(200);
});

test('Should not login with bad credentials', async () => {
    await request(app).post('/users/login').send({
        email: 'wrongEmail@gmail.com',
        password: 'wrongEmail'
    }).expect(400);
});
```
To check the api mehtod, we use the given syntax: `request` from `supertest` library, `app` is our `app.js` file.

In the first testing method, I have tested creating a new user. If the user is created properly, I expect to see 201 status message, so I write it `expect(201)`. If any error occurs during the process, the test case will fail. After using this test, one example user will be created and the second time we run this test case with the same example data, there will be error, because we have already created a user with these credentials. So, we need a specific method which purges all the database before the test case runs. For this, we have a specific method named `beforeEach(()=>{})`.

> [!report 2]
> In the second test, I have tested when I enter correct login credentials, whether it sends 200 status code or not. If yes, it is ok, otherwise fail. To be able to do that, I have created a example document (`userOne`). Because the all data are deleted before the test cases are done, we need to create this example data in `beforeEach` function after the deleting everything.


> [!report 3] 
> In the third case, I have just checked, whether it sends 400 status code in case I enter wrong credentials. If this returns 400 code, that means, the program works appropriately, otherwise there is a problem.
