Most times, we run our program from `index.js` file. However, there is a second case when we do not run this, instead we run files in test folder with jest. To be able to do both process easily, we need to configure package.json a little.

So, we need to possess `script` object inside `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js",
    "dev": "env-cmd -f ./config/dev.env nodemon src/index.js",
    "test": "env-cmd -f ./config/test.env jest --watch"
  }
```
----
Here's an explanation of each script in the `scripts` object you've provided:

### 1. **`"start"`:**

```json
"start": "node src/index.js"
```

- **Purpose**: Runs your application in production mode.
- **Explanation**:
    - `node src/index.js`: This command runs your `index.js` file located inside the `src` folder using Node.js.
    - **When to use**: Use this script when you want to run your app in a production environment, without any live-reloading or special development tools.

### 2. **`"dev"`:**

```json
"dev": "env-cmd -f ./config/dev.env nodemon src/index.js"
```

- **Purpose**: Runs your application in development mode with live-reloading using `nodemon` and loads environment variables from the `dev.env` file.
- **Explanation**:
    - `env-cmd -f ./config/dev.env`: This tells the `env-cmd` tool to load environment variables from the `dev.env` file located in the `config` folder.
    - `nodemon src/index.js`: This runs your `index.js` file using `nodemon`, a tool that automatically restarts your app when any changes are detected in the source files.
    - **When to use**: Use this script in development. It ensures your environment variables (such as database credentials, API keys, etc.) are loaded and your app is automatically restarted when files change, helping with rapid development.

### 3. **`"test"`:**

```json
"test": "env-cmd -f ./config/test.env jest --watch"
```

- **Purpose**: Runs tests using Jest, with environment variables loaded from `test.env`, and watches for changes.
- **Explanation**:
    - `env-cmd -f ./config/test.env`: Loads the environment variables from the `test.env` file located in the `config` folder.
    - `jest --watch`: This runs Jest in "watch mode," meaning it will re-run the tests automatically whenever a file in your project changes. This is useful during development to keep tests running and to see changes immediately.
    - **When to use**: Use this script to run your tests in the `test` folder with specific environment variables. Itâ€™s especially useful for test-driven development (TDD), where you want Jest to constantly watch for file changes and re-run tests automatically.

### Summary:

- **`start`**: Runs the app normally (no live-reloading).
- **`dev`**: Runs the app in development mode with live-reloading (`nodemon`) and environment variables from `dev.env`.
- **`test`**: Runs Jest tests in watch mode with environment variables from `test.env`.
