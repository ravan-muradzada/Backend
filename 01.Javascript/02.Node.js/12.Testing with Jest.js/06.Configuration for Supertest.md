As you know, Supertest is a library which helps us to test api methods: [[05.Supertest|Supertest]]
For supertest, first we need api environment configuration which is done in `index.js` file. However, supertest library does not need explicit `app.listen` function, however in `index.js` there is. So that refers, we should make changes on `index.js`.
The best thing is that:
We create another `js` file in `src` folder named `app.js`. Inside this file, we write everything in `index.js` except `app.listen` part:
```javascript
// app.js file
const express = require('express');
require('./db/mongoose')
const userRouter = require('./routers/user');
const taskRouter = require('./routers/task');

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(userRouter);
app.use(taskRouter);

module.exports = app;
```

And in `index.js` file, we call (`require`) this file and use `app.listen`:
```javascript
const app = require('./app');
const port = process.env.PORT; // in local

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server started on Port ${port}`);
});
```
