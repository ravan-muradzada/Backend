You have already known that we have created a profile picture. 
Let's create a test case for it whether the program can createt an avatar properly or not. For this, we just need create a folder inside the tests directory to store the example data (pictures). It is better to give `fixtures` as a name to this new folder.
Now, it is time to write testcase:
```javascript
test('Should upload avatar', async () => {
    await request(app).post('/users/me/avatar')
    .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${userOne.tokens[0].token}`)
    .attach('avatar', 'tests/fixtures/profile-picture.jpg')
    .expect(200);


    const user = await User.findById(userOneId);
    expect(user.avatar).toEqual(expect.any(Buffer));
});
```
