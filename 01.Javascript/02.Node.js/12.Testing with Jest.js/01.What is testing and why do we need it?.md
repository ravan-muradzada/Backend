### What is Testing?

**Testing** is the process of evaluating a software application to ensure it behaves as expected under specific conditions. It involves identifying and fixing bugs, verifying functionality, and ensuring the software meets user and business requirements.

In simple terms, testing checks if the software is **working correctly** and is **reliable**.

### Why Do We Need Testing?

1. **To Ensure Correctness**  
    Testing verifies that the application functions as intended, producing the correct outputs for given inputs.
    
2. **To Identify and Fix Bugs**  
    Bugs can cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or incorrect results. Testing helps uncover and fix these issues before they affect users.
    
3. **To Improve Software Quality**  
    A well-tested application is more reliable, robust, and easier to maintain, enhancing the overall quality.
    
4. **To Save Time and Money**  
    Catching and fixing bugs early during development is less expensive than addressing them after deployment.
    
5. **To Ensure User Satisfaction**  
    High-quality software that works as expected builds trust and satisfaction among users.
    
6. **To Handle Changing Requirements**  
    Continuous testing ensures the software adapts to new features or updates without breaking existing functionality.
    
7. **To Prevent Security Issues**  
    Testing can identify vulnerabilities, helping to secure sensitive data and prevent potential attacks.

### Types of Testing

1. **Manual Testing**  
    Performed by humans who execute test cases without automation tools.
    
2. **Automated Testing**  
    Uses scripts and tools to test software (e.g., Jest, Selenium, JUnit).
    
3. **Functional Testing**  
    Verifies the softwareâ€™s functionality meets requirements (e.g., testing a login system).
    
4. **Unit Testing**  
    Tests individual components or functions (e.g., checking if a math function adds numbers correctly).
    
5. **Integration Testing**  
    Ensures different modules of the software work together.
    
6. **Performance Testing**  
    Evaluates how the software performs under load or stress.
    
7. **Acceptance Testing**  
    Confirms the software meets user needs and business requirements.
