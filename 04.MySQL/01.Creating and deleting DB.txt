To be able to create a new database, we should use this command:

"CREATE DATABASE new_db_name;"


If we want to remove a database, we should use this command:

"DROP DATABASE database_name;"


We might have multiple databases, to choose which of them we want to work, we need to use this command:

"USE database_name;"


------------------------

If we want to make the database read only, we can use this command:

"ALTER DATABASEE db_name READ ONLY = 1".

To revert it to be modifiable, we can replace "1" with "0" here.
