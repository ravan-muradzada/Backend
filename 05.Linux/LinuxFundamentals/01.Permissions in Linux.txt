In Linux, file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.
When we write the command: "ls -l", we can see file's permissions. It is written like "r, w, -".
In each line the first character determines the type of the file:

- -> for a regular file
d -> for a directory
l -> for a symbolic link, among others.

For permissions there are three characters:
r means read permission
w means write permission
x means execute permission

After this character, there are permissions.
The first permission is owner permission.
Then sequentially, there are group and other permissions.

Example:

-rw-r--r--

We can understand it from the first chararacter, that is a regular file. The next three characters "rw-" means that the owner has reading and writing permissions, but not executing.
The group has read permission only (r--).
Others have read permission only (r--).

After the permission part, there is a number which represents the number of hard links.
The next name is user name and after that you can see your current group name. Sequentially, we can see, file size, last modification date and time and file name.

--------------------------------------------------

It is possible to change the permission, for that we use chmod command.
The syntax is like that:
"chmod u+x filename"

Here, u stands for user (owner), g for group, and o for others.
"+" means adding the permission.
The part after "+" is for permission name.

Moreover, using this command we can remove permissions from the user. Example: 
chmod -w filename.
