A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically reconcile differences between two branches. This typically happens when changes are made to the same lines of a file in different branches, or when a file has been deleted in one branch but modified in another.

Merge conflicts can arise in several scenarios, such as:

Two developers modify the same lines of a file in different branches.
One developer modifies a file while another deletes it in a different branch.
Reordering or restructuring code in a way that Git cannot automatically determine which change should take precedence.

How to solve the problem?
Let's imagine a specific case, we have a master branch and one additional branch named "dev".
Firsy, we create "file.txt" in dev branch and write there some information, then create the file with the same name in mater branch and add here different information. In master branch, after we merge it, the conflict will occur.

In the file.txt (in master branch), you will see something like that(the words there master and dev are contents):
<<<<<<< HEAD
master
=======
dev
>>>>>>> dev

We just manually should delete <<<Head, === and >>>dev part and also delete one of the content. At the last, just one of the contents should stay here.
Then we should add this file to staging area and commit that.
