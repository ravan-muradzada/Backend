Pull Requests and Merge Requests are fundamental concepts in Git-based collaborative development. They are used to propose changes, review code, and eventually merge updates into a main or target branch. Although they are conceptually similar, the terminology can vary between platforms:

- Pull Request is commonly used in GitHub.
- Merge Request is used in GitLab.

Propose Changes: Suggest modifications made in one branch to be merged into another branch.
Review Code: Team members can review the changes before they are merged.
Discuss and Improve: Developers can leave comments, suggest improvements, and make additional changes.
Merge Changes: After approval, the changes can be merged into the target branch.

When you merge branches, Git integrates the changes from one branch into another. The goal is to incorporate updates from one branch into another branch, typically from a feature branch into the main branch.

Sample merging process:

We have a main branch with some files. Moreover, there are two more branches with the name; "Dev1" and "Dev2".
The first developer adds to his branch(Dev1) the file called "file_1.txt", and the second developer adds to his branch(Dev2) the file called "file_2.txt".
After their both merge their branches to the main branch, in the main branch, both files will be available.
