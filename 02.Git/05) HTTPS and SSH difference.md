HTTPS and SSH are two different methods for connecting to Git repositories, each with its own approach to security and authentication. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data exchanged between your computer and the server. It typically requires a username and password or a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication. While HTTPS is relatively easy to set up and works well through firewalls and proxies, it may require you to enter credentials for each operation unless configured with a credential manager. On the other hand, SSH (Secure Shell) employs public-key cryptography for a more secure connection. It involves generating an SSH key pair, where the public key is added to your Git service account and the private key remains on your local machine. SSH offers enhanced security by avoiding the need to transmit credentials over the network and provides a more convenient experience for frequent interactions since it eliminates the need for repeated password entries. However, setting up SSH can be more complex, requiring the management of SSH keys and ensuring the private key's security.
