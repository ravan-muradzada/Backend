Branching is a feature in Git that allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work without affecting that main line. Think of a branch as a separate timeline for your project. Each branch can have its own commits, changes, and history. Branching is essential for managing different features, bug fixes, and even different versions of your project.

The default branch that typically holds the stable production-ready version of your code is called main (or master) branch.

Each branch in Git is isolated, meaning that changes made in one branch do not affect other branches unless you explicitly merge them.
Imagine it like the file have two variations in different branches.

1) To create a new branch, we use that command:
'git branch <branch name>'

2) To list all local branches, we can use that command:
'git branch'

3) To list all remote branches, we can use that command:
'git branch -r'

4) To list both local and remote branches, we can use this command:
'git branch -a'

5) To switch to the specificed branch, we can use this command:
'git checkout <branch name>'

6) Both to create a new branch and switch it, we can use this command:
'git command -b <branch name>'

7) To remove a branch, we can use that command:
'git branch -d branch-name'
-d shows --delete.

8) To switch to an existing branch, we can also use that command:
'git switch branch-name'

9) To create and switch to a new branch, we can use this command:
'git switch -c new-branch-name'
