## What Are Sessions?

A **session** is a way for PHP to remember information (data) about a user **across multiple pages or requests**.

Think of it like a sticky note PHP attaches to each user while they browse your site, so you can keep track of who they are or what they did.

## Why do we need sessions?

HTTP (the web) is **stateless** — every page load is independent, so by default PHP forgets everything about the user from one page to another.

Sessions fix this by storing user data **on the server**, and linking it to the user by a unique **session ID** stored in a cookie.

## How sessions work in PHP — basic flow:

1. User visits your site for the first time.
    
2. PHP creates a **session ID** — a unique string.
    
3. PHP stores this ID in a **cookie** on the user’s browser.
    
4. On the server, PHP keeps data linked to this session ID.
    
5. On next page loads, browser sends the session cookie, PHP uses it to retrieve stored data.

## How to use sessions in PHP

```php
<?php
session_start();  // Start or resume session

// Store data
$_SESSION['username'] = 'Mr. Ravan';

// Access data
echo "Hello, " . $_SESSION['username'];

// Remove data
unset($_SESSION['username']);

// Destroy the entire session
session_destroy();
```

## Important Notes:

- You **must call `session_start()` at the very beginning** (before any output) on every page where you want to access session data.
    
- Session data is stored on the server, not in the browser.
    
- Session ID is usually stored in a cookie called `PHPSESSID`.
    
- Sessions are temporary; by default, they expire when the browser closes or after a timeout.

## When to use sessions?

- User login/authentication
    
- Shopping carts
    
- Temporary preferences or settings
    
- Multi-step forms
