## What is `apiResource`?

- It’s like `Route::resource()`, but **specifically designed for APIs**.
    
- It **excludes the `create` and `edit` routes** because those are for showing HTML forms — which APIs don’t need.
    
- So, you get routes only for the data actions:  
    `index`, `store`, `show`, `update`, `destroy`.
    
- Perfect for RESTful API endpoints.

-------
## How to create it?

```bash
php artisan make:controller ControllerName --api
```

---

### Example of `apiResource`:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\PostController;

Route::apiResource('posts', PostController::class);
```

This creates these routes:

|HTTP Verb|URI|Action|Controller Method|
|---|---|---|---|
|GET|/posts|index|`index()`|
|POST|/posts|store|`store()`|
|GET|/posts/{id}|show|`show($id)`|
|PUT/PATCH|/posts/{id}|update|`update($id)`|
|DELETE|/posts/{id}|destroy|`destroy($id)`|

No routes for:

- `GET /posts/create`
    
- `GET /posts/{id}/edit`
    
---

## Summary

- `apiResource` = resource routes without form-related routes (`create`, `edit`).
    
- Use `apiResource` for API endpoints — RESTful and clean.
    

---------
## What is `apiResources`?

- `apiResources` is the **plural version** of `apiResource`.
    
- It lets you **register multiple API resource controllers at once** with a single call.
    
- Instead of calling `Route::apiResource()` repeatedly for each controller, you pass an array of resource-controller pairs.
    
- Saves you from repeating code and keeps routes file clean.

### How to use `apiResources`?

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\PostController;
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;

Route::apiResources([
    'posts' => PostController::class,
    'users' => UserController::class,
]);
```

This will create the standard API resource routes (`index`, `show`, `store`, `update`, `destroy`) for both **posts** and **users**.

---

### Why use `apiResources`?

- Cleaner, DRYer route definitions.
    
- Perfect for APIs where you manage multiple resources.
    
- Keeps your `routes/api.php` or `routes/web.php` tidy.
    
- Supports all the features of `apiResource`, just for multiple controllers.

### Quick example with middleware and prefix grouping:

```php
Route::prefix('v1')->middleware('auth:api')->group(function () {
    Route::apiResources([
        'posts' => PostController::class,
        'users' => UserController::class,
        'comments' => CommentController::class,
    ]);
});
```

---

### TL;DR

- `apiResources` = bulk version of `apiResource`.
    
- Registers multiple API resource controllers with one call.
    
- Generates only the API-friendly RESTful routes (no `create` or `edit`).
    
- Makes managing many API endpoints easier and cleaner.
