### `php artisan route:cache`

**What it does:**

- It **compiles all your route definitions into a single cached file**.
    
- This means Laravel doesn’t have to parse all your routes every time someone hits your app.
    
- It speeds up route registration massively, especially in big apps with tons of routes.
    

**Why use it?**

- Boosts your app’s performance — routes load faster.
    
- Essential for **production** environments where speed and efficiency matter.
    
- Helps reduce the overhead of routing during each request.
    

**How to use:**

```bash
php artisan route:cache
```

**Important:**  
If your routes use closures (anonymous functions), this command will **fail** because closures can’t be serialized. Routes need to use controller methods or named callbacks.

### `php artisan route:clear`

**What it does:**

- It **removes the cached routes file**.
    
- Laravel goes back to parsing routes normally (from the route files).
    

**Why use it?**

- After you update or add routes, you want to clear the old cache.
    
- Otherwise, Laravel will keep using the outdated cached routes.
    
- Use it during development or right before running `route:cache` again.
    

**How to use:**

```bash
php artisan route:clear
```

### TL;DR: When & why?

- Use **`route:cache`** before deploying your Laravel app to production for maximum route performance.
    
- Use **`route:clear`** when you make changes to your routes so Laravel doesn’t keep serving stale cached routes.
    
- Don’t use `route:cache` if you have closures in your route definitions.
    
- Think of route caching as a **speed boost** — necessary once your app grows bigger.
