## 📄 What is Pagination?

Pagination is the process of **splitting a large dataset into smaller, manageable pages** — so your app loads faster and is easier to use.

## 🔧 Laravel Pagination Basics

Laravel makes pagination super easy using Eloquent:

```php
$ninjas = Ninja::paginate(10); // 10 records per page
```

You pass the paginated data to your view, like:

```php
return view('ninjas.index', ['ninjas' => $ninjas]);
```

---

## 🖼️ In the Blade View

Use `->links()` to show page controls:

```blade
@foreach ($ninjas as $ninja)
    <p>{{ $ninja->name }}</p>
@endforeach

{{ $ninjas->links() }}
```

This generates HTML for "Previous", "Next", and page numbers using Tailwind CSS (by default).

---

## 🛠️ Customization

You can also use:

- `simplePaginate(10)` — simpler pagination with only "Previous" and "Next"
    
- Custom views:
    

```php
$ninjas->links('custom.pagination.view')
```

## 🔍 URL Example

When you visit `/ninjas?page=2`, Laravel automatically knows which set of results to show — no extra setup needed.

## ✅ Summary

- Use `paginate()` in controllers to split data into pages.
    
- Use `->links()` in Blade to render pagination controls.
    
- Efficient, clean, and works out-of-the-box.
