## 1. How to create a controller in Laravel

Run this in your terminal inside your Laravel project:

```bash
php artisan make:controller MyController
```

- This creates `app/Http/Controllers/MyController.php`.
    
- Inside, you get a clean class ready for your methods (actions).
    

If you want a **resource controller** (with standard REST methods like index, show, store), you can do:

```bash
php artisan make:controller ProductController --resource
```

## 2. How to call a controller method from routes

Suppose you have this controller:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class MyController extends Controller
{
    public function show()
    {
        return 'Showing something';
    }
}
```

You link it in your `routes/web.php` like this:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\MyController;

Route::get('/show', [MyController::class, 'show']);
```

---

## 3. Grouping routes by controller

Grouping is a clean way to avoid repeating the controller name and to keep routes organized.

**Syntax:**

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\ProductController;

Route::controller(ProductController::class)->group(function () {
    Route::get('/products', 'index');
    Route::post('/products', 'store');
    Route::get('/products/{id}', 'show');
});
```

This means:

- All routes inside the group use `ProductController`.
    
- For each route, you just specify the method name as a string (`'index'`, `'store'`, etc.).
    
- Cleaner and less repetitive.

### Alternative: Route prefix + controller grouping

If your routes share a URL prefix too:

```php
Route::prefix('products')->controller(ProductController::class)->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', 'index');          // matches /products
    Route::post('/', 'store');         // matches POST /products
    Route::get('/{id}', 'show');       // matches /products/{id}
});
```

---

## Why use grouping?

- Keeps your `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php` DRY.
    
- Easier maintenance and better readability.
    
- Makes your app scalable â€” easy to add/remove routes from the group.
    
- Supports middlewares and prefixes on the whole group (e.g., auth).
    

---

## Quick recap

- Create controller with `php artisan make:controller`.
    
- Call controller method in route as `[ControllerClass::class, 'methodName']`.
    
- Use `Route::controller()` with a closure group to bundle routes sharing the same controller.
    
- Combine with `Route::prefix()` for URL structure organization.
