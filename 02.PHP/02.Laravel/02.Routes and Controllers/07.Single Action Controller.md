### Why use Single Action Controllers?

- Cleaner for simple tasks.
    
- Easier to test and reuse.
    
- Keeps your code organized instead of using closures in routes.
    
- Works perfectly with route caching (no closures!).

### How to create one?

Run this command:

```bash
php artisan make:controller CheckoutController --invokable
```

This creates a controller like this:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class CheckoutController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(Request $request)
    {
        // Your single action logic here
        return 'Processing checkout';
    }
}
```

### How to use it in routes?

You don’t need to specify the method name since it’s a single action controller:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\CheckoutController;

Route::post('/checkout', CheckoutController::class);
```

Laravel automatically calls the `__invoke()` method when the `/checkout` route is hit.

### Summary

- Single Action Controller = controller with only `__invoke()` method.
    
- Created with `--invokable` flag.
    
- Called in routes just by the controller class name.
    
- Perfect for simple, one-purpose actions.
    
- Cleaner and better for route caching compared to closures.
