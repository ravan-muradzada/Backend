### `@include` in Laravel Blade

`@include` inserts another Blade view inside your current view — like a reusable partial.

---

### Basic usage:

```blade
@include('partials.header')
```

This renders `resources/views/partials/header.blade.php` right there.

---

### Passing data to included view:

```blade
@include('partials.user', ['user' => $user])
```

You can pass variables to the included view like this.

---

### Variations:

- `@includeIf('view.name')` — includes only if the view exists (avoids errors).
    
- `@includeWhen($condition, 'view.name')` — includes only if `$condition` is true.
    
- `@includeUnless($condition, 'view.name')` — includes only if `$condition` is false.
    
- `@each('view.name', $items, 'item')` — loops over `$items`, includes the view for each, passing `item` as variable.

### Summary:

|Directive|What it does|
|---|---|
|`@include`|Includes a view unconditionally|
|`@includeIf`|Includes only if view exists|
|`@includeWhen`|Includes if condition true|
|`@includeUnless`|Includes if condition false|
|`@each`|Loops over array, includes view per item|

---

### Example:

```blade
@includeWhen($user->isAdmin(), 'admin.panel', ['user' => $user])
```

Includes `admin.panel` only if user is admin.
