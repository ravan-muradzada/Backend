## 🌱 What Are Seeders in Laravel?

**Seeders** are classes used to **insert sample (or default) data into your database**.

> Think of them as "auto-fill scripts" for your tables — useful in development, testing, and initial setup.

---

## 📁 Where Are Seeders Stored?

Location:

```
database/seeders/
```

Default file created with every Laravel project:

```
DatabaseSeeder.php
```

You can create custom seeders like this:

```bash
php artisan make:seeder NinjaSeeder
```

---

## 🛠️ Example Seeder File

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use App\Models\Ninja;

class NinjaSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run(): void
    {
        Ninja::factory()->count(10)->create();
    }
}
```

This uses a **factory** to insert 10 fake ninjas into the database.

---

## ▶️ Running Seeders

### Run all:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

This runs `DatabaseSeeder.php`, which can call other seeders:

```php
public function run(): void
{
    $this->call([
        NinjaSeeder::class,
        UserSeeder::class,
    ]);
}
```

### Run specific:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=NinjaSeeder
```

## 🧠 Why Use Seeders?

|Use Case|Example|
|---|---|
|🧪 Testing Features|Seed fake users or products to test your UI/API|
|🛠️ Dev Environment Setup|Fill DB quickly after cloning a project|
|🧰 Default Config|Seed roles, permissions, categories, etc.|
|🔁 Reproducible Data|Everyone on team gets same test data|

---

## 🧨 Seeder vs Factory

|Seeder|Factory|
|---|---|
|Runs logic to **insert**|Generates **fake data**|
|Usually calls a factory|Defines how fake data looks|
|Lives in `database/seeders`|Lives in `database/factories`|

Seeder uses a factory to fill the DB — factory doesn't insert, seeder does.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Seeders insert sample data into your DB**
    
- Mostly used in **development** or **testing**
    
- Paired with **factories** to generate bulk fake records
    
- Run via `php artisan db:seed` or `--class=...`
    
- **Not meant for production real data**, but can seed default config (like admin roles)
