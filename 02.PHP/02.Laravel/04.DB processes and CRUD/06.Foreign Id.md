Sometimes we need to combine some tables while working in laravel. For that we need to add id of the second table to the main table.
```php
// Users table
$table->foreignId('post_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');
```
Here we created a connection between users and posts tables. We should give it the name which needs to be related to posts. If the name of the table is **Post**, we need to give it **post_id**.

- **`constrained()`**: Automatically sets the foreign key to reference the `id` column of the related table (based on the column name).
    
- **`onDelete('cascade')`**: When the related record is deleted, this record will also be deleted automatically.
    
- **Example**:
    
    ```php
    $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');
    ```
    
    This means:
    
    - `user_id` references `id` on `users` table
        
    - If a user is deleted, related records (with that `user_id`) are deleted too.
----
We need to add new factory and seeding files for the second table.
```php
// Factory 
public function definition(): array {
	return [
		...,
		'post_id' => Post::inRandomOrder()->first()->id
	];
}
```

```php
// Seeding
public function run(): void {
	Post::factory()->count(10)->create();
}
```
While adding seedings to the main seeding file, we need to put **Post** first before the owner table.

---
We may add functionalities to the both table that help them to access each other's data.
```php
// We add this to User model.
public function user() {
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
}
```

```php
// We add this to Post model.
public function posts() {
    return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
}
```
----
We may fetch the data related to the posts of the user while fetching info about him. To make it faster, we can use this logic:
```php
public function index() {
	$ninjas = Ninja::with('posts')->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->paginate(10);
    return view(...);
}
```
