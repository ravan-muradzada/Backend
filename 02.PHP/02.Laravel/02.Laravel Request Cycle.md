![[laravel-request-cycle.png]]
This diagram shows the **Laravel request lifecycle**, which starts when the browser sends a request to the **entry script** (`public/index.php`). Laravel then loads dependencies (`vendor/autoload.php`), creates the application (`bootstrap/app.php`), and registers **service providers**. The **router** determines the route and passes the request through **middlewares**, which may modify or reject it. Then it hits a **controller/action or closure**, where we write the business logic. A **view** is optionally rendered and returned as a **response** to the browser.

As developers, we mainly interact with **routes**, **controllers**, **models**, **views**, and sometimes **middlewares**, while the internal bootstrapping and framework logic (like `index.php`, `autoload`, and `app.php`) is handled automatically by Laravel.
