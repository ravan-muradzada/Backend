First, we need to use this command:
```bash
laravel new our_project_name
```
We choose `sqlite` while selecting database. When the project is created, we need to run this command:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
Then, you can run the app:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

Then we either click the link or go to:
```http
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
