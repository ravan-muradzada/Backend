## What are Resource Controllers?

- **Resource Controllers** are controllers that automatically handle the standard set of CRUD operations:  
    **Create, Read, Update, Delete** — basically everything you need to manage a resource.
    
- Laravel **generates all the typical methods** for you like `index`, `show`, `create`, `store`, `edit`, `update`, and `destroy`.
    
- They **save you from writing repetitive route definitions and controller methods**.

## How to create a Resource Controller?

Run this command:

```bash
php artisan make:controller PostController --resource
```

This generates a controller with these methods stubbed out:

- `index()` — show all posts
    
- `create()` — show form to create a new post
    
- `store()` — save new post
    
- `show($id)` — show a single post
    
- `edit($id)` — show form to edit post
    
- `update($id)` — update the post
    
- `destroy($id)` — delete the post

## How to use Resource Controller in routes?

You just need **one line** in your `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php`:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\PostController;

Route::resource('posts', PostController::class);
```

Laravel automatically registers all the RESTful routes for posts, for example:

|HTTP Verb|URL|Action|Controller Method|
|---|---|---|---|
|GET|/posts|index|`index()`|
|GET|/posts/create|create|`create()`|
|POST|/posts|store|`store()`|
|GET|/posts/{id}|show|`show($id)`|
|GET|/posts/{id}/edit|edit|`edit($id)`|
|PUT/PATCH|/posts/{id}|update|`update($id)`|
|DELETE|/posts/{id}|destroy|`destroy($id)`|

## Why use Resource Controllers?

- Saves tons of time writing routes and controller methods.
    
- Enforces RESTful conventions — good for API design.
    
- Easy to customize and extend only what you need.
    
- Great for CRUD apps and backend APIs.
    
- Works well with Laravel’s features like route model binding and form requests.

## TL;DR

- Resource Controllers give you a full CRUD controller with a single Artisan command.
    
- One `Route::resource()` line generates all RESTful routes.
    
- They keep your code clean, consistent, and follow best practices.
