It is easy and useful to use terminal while working different kinds of files. In Linux terminal we have some quick methods to add, overwrite the files. They are called redirection.

To redirect information to an existing file, the user must have write permissions on that file.

If we want to add something to a file, the standard way is to open the file with any text editor, add the text, save and close it.

Instead, especially if we need to add small strings, we can use ">" or ">>".

---------------------------------------------

Usage of ">":

If we have a file names "file.txt" and want add there "Hello My File", we can write something like that:

echo "Hello My File" > file.txt

This command first deletes the content of file.txt and then write "Hello My File" here.

If we want to write the content of the first file to the second file, we can use this command:
cat firstFile.txt > secondFile.txt 

It deletes the content of the second file and write the content of the first file here.

---------------------------------------------

Usage of ">>":

Its usage is pretty similar to the previous one, but the only difference is that before adding a text to a file, it does not delete the content of the file. It just appends the text.

So we can add new string to the file and the content of another file to this file without deleting its own content.
