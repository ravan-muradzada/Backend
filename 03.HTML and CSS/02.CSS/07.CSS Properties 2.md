While creating user friendly applications, we always need to use CSS carefully and in this section, we will learn more about css properties:
```css
.subscribe-button {
    background-color: rgb(200, 0, 0);
    color: white; /* Color of the text */
    width: 130px; /* Width of the element (currently it is button) */
    height: 50px; /* Height of the element (currently it is button) */
    border-radius: 5px; /* It shows how much curve is element's nodes. */
    font-size: 14px; /* the size of the font */
    border: none; /* No explicit border */
    cursor: pointer; /* It helps when we put the mouse on hte button */
    margin-left: 8px; /* It determines the distance between the element's left border and the next element/ */
    margin-right: 12px; /* The same logic for the right border */
    transition: opacity 0.15s; /* It is used to set transition time for the 'hover' and 'active' */
}
```

### What are hover and active?
```css
/* This determines the features of the element when we keep the mouse on the element. */
.subscribe-button:hover {
    opacity: 0.8;
}

/* This determines the features of the element when we click the mouse on the element. */
.subscribe-button:active {
    opacity: 0.8;
}
```

### What is padding?
Working with just `width` and `height` may cause sometimes some problems, especially when the text size inside the element increases. So we need to dynamic distance determinator for the elements and that is `padding`. So when we even increase or decrease the text size in the element, it  will automatically saves its main view. It has four sides.
We can change the first code like that:
```css
.subscribe-button {
    background-color: rgb(200, 0, 0);
    color: white; 

    /* Updated part (width and height have been changed with paddings... */
    padding-left: 30px; 
    padding-right: 30px;
    padding-top: 10px;
    padding-bottom: 10px;
    
    border-radius: 5px;
    font-size: 14px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    margin-left: 8px; 
    margin-right: 12px; 
    transition: opacity 0.15s;
}
```
