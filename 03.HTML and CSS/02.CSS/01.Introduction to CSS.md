### What is CSS and Why Do We Use It?

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a stylesheet language used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements. It separates content (HTML) from design, making web pages more visually appealing and easier to maintain.

#### Why Use CSS?

- **Enhances Styling**: Controls colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
- **Improves Maintainability**: Separates design from content, making updates easier.
- **Ensures Consistency**: Applies the same styles across multiple pages.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts pages for different screen sizes.

### How to Add CSS to HTML

There are three ways to apply CSS to an HTML document:

#### 1. **Inline CSS** (Applied directly to an element)

- Used for quick, one-time styling.
- Not recommended for large projects due to poor maintainability.

Example:

```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is an inline-styled paragraph.</p>
```

#### 2. **Internal CSS** (Defined inside the `<style>` tag in the `<head>`)

- Useful for single-page styling.
- Keeps styles in one place but doesn't separate content from design efficiently.

Example:

```html
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: red;
            font-size: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This paragraph uses internal CSS.</p>
</body>
```

#### 3. **External CSS** (Stored in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML)

- Best for large projects, ensuring consistency and easier maintenance.

Example:  
**Create a CSS file (`styles.css`):**

```css
p {
    color: green;
    font-size: 22px;
}
```

**Link it in HTML (`index.html`):**

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <p>This paragraph uses external CSS.</p>
</body>
```

### Best Practice

Use **external CSS** for maintainability, internal CSS for page-specific styling, and inline CSS only for quick fixes or dynamic styling.
