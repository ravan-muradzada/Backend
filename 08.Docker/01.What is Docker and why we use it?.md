### **What is Docker?**

Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into **lightweight, portable containers**. These containers ensure that the application runs **consistently across different environments**, such as development, testing, and production.

### **What is Docker Used For?**

1. **Consistent Development Environment** – Works the same on any OS (Linux, macOS, Windows).
2. **Microservices Architecture** – Runs different parts of an app as independent containers.
3. **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automates testing and deployment in DevOps.
4. **Scalability & Cloud Deployment** – Easily scales apps using Kubernetes.
5. **Isolation** – Keeps applications and dependencies separate from the host system.

### **Main Components of Docker**

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**Docker Engine**|The runtime that runs and manages containers.|
|**Docker CLI**|Command-line interface to interact with Docker.|
|**Docker Image**|A blueprint for containers, including app code and dependencies.|
|**Docker Container**|A running instance of a Docker image.|
|**Dockerfile**|A script defining how to build a Docker image.|
|**Docker Compose**|A tool to define and run multi-container applications.|
|**Docker Hub**|A public registry to share and store Docker images.|
|**Containerd**|The lower-level container runtime that manages container execution.|

### **What is a Container?**

A **container** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable unit that includes everything needed to run an application:

- **Code**
- **Runtime (Node.js, Python, etc.)**
- **Libraries & Dependencies**
- **System Tools & Configurations**

Containers **isolate applications** from the underlying system, ensuring that they run **consistently** across different environments (development, testing, production).
