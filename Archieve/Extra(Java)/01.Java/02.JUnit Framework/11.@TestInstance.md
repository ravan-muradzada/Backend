@TestInstance is an annotation in JUnit 5 that allows you to specify how the test instances of a test class are created. By default, JUnit creates a new instance of the test class for each test method, which is known as per-method instantiation. However, you can change this behavior to per-class instantiation by using the @TestInstance annotation.

Usage of @TestInstance

You can use @TestInstance with two modes:

1) TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_METHOD (default): This is the default behavior where a new instance of the test class is created for each test method. Each test method runs in isolation with a fresh instance.

2) TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS: When you specify this mode, JUnit creates a single instance of the test class and reuses it for all test methods. This allows you to share instance variables between test methods.
Moreover, in this mode we can use @BefereAll and @AfterAll annotations without making their method static.

@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
class ExampleTest_Add {
    private int counter = 0;
    @BeforeAll
    public void messageBeforeAll(){
        System.out.println("Testing for the class has started!");
    }

    @BeforeEach
    public void beforeEach(){
        System.out.println("Before each");
        counter++;
    }
    @Test
    public void addMethodCheck_1(){
        Example e = new Example();
        int resultOfCode = e.add(7, 8);
        int expectedResult = 15;
        assertEquals(expectedResult, resultOfCode);
        // First expected (true) result, then the result
        // of our code.
    }

    @Test
    public void addMethod_2(){
        assertEquals(12, (new Example()).add(8, 4));
        // Short way
    }

    @Test
    public void addMethod3(){
        assertEquals(18, (new Example()).add(10, 8));
    }


    @AfterAll
    public void messageAfterAll(){
        System.out.println("Testing for the class has finished!");
        System.out.println("Counter is " + this.counter);
        // The result will be 3, because there are test methods,
        // so beforeEach method was called three times.
    }
}
