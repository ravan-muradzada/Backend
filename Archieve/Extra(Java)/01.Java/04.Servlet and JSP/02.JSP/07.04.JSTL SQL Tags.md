To get more information about JSTL and its core tags, look at:
[[07.01.What is JSTL?|What is JSTL?]]
[[07.02.JSTL Core Tags|JSTL Core Tags]]

In addition to them, we can also use some tags from JSTL for SQL. So we can fetch data easily using these tags.


> [!INFO] **JSTL** Configuration
> To be able to use tags in **JSTL**, we should import this library: `http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql`.
>
> So, using **taglib**, we should write something like that:
> `<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql" prefix="sql" %>`
> We will use **sql** as prefix for JSTL tags. 
> 
> To be able to import this library, first we should download it from the internet, like [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/). Then we need to put it to ***lib*** library. Its relative path from **Application Folder**:
> `./src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib`.
> 
> Moreover, we need to add **JDBC** driver to that directory.

We use **JDBC** steps to be able to work with SQL. 
So, first we have to load the driver and register. In *registration* part we need these three things: 
*url, username, password.*

	<sql:setDataSource var="db" driver="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/myDB" user="root" password="password" />

This code spinnet helps us to load the driver and register using our cridentials.

After that, we can create our query and execute it using this code:

	<sql:query var="rs" dataSource="${db}">
		SELECT * FROM students;
	</sql:query>

`rs` here represents Result List object and our fetched information is stored inside it.

If we want to print the data from `rs`, we can write something like that:

	<c:forEach var="row" items="${rs.rows}">e
		<p>
			ID: ${row.id}, First name: ${row.first_name}, 
			Last name: ${row.last_name}
		</p>
	</c:forEach>
