Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, so it can be saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database. The byte stream contains the object's data and metadata (information about its type and structure), which allows it to be reconstructed later. This is known as deserialization, which is the reverse process—converting the byte stream back into an object.

Why Do We Need Serialization?

-Persistence: Store objects in files or databases so they can be retrieved later.
-Network Communication: Send objects over a network (e.g., in distributed systems or remote procedure calls).
-Caching: Save the state of objects in memory to disk for faster retrieval in the future.
-Deep Cloning: Create deep copies of objects by serializing and deserializing them.


Serializable Interface

The Serializable interface in Java is a marker interface—it does not contain any methods but serves as a signal to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that the class is eligible for serialization. To serialize an object, the class of the object must implement the Serializable interface.


------------------------------------------------------

serialVersionUID

serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for each class that is used during the deserialization process to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.

Why Use serialVersionUID?

If a class definition changes (e.g., fields are added or removed), and the serialVersionUID does not match, an InvalidClassException is thrown. Defining the serialVersionUID manually helps avoid this.

If serialVersionUID is not explicitly defined, the JVM generates it based on class details, which can be inconsistent across different compilers.

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;


Externalization

Externalization is an alternative to serialization that gives the programmer more control over the process. Unlike the Serializable interface, which automatically handles the serialization of all non-transient fields, classes implementing Externalizable must define how fields are serialized and deserialized.

-writeExternal(): Method to define how data is written.
-readExternal(): Method to define how data is read.
