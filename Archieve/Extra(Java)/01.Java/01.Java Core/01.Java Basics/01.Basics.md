In java, when we use " == " operator for int variables, the values are
checked here. Everything happens in stack.

However, if we do it for Integer datatype, there will be places in heap
for the value of the variable.  

Here, " == " operator will check the references of them.
If the values of two Integers are in the
range of [-128, 127], the same place in heap is used for both, that is
why if the values are the same, it will return true.

Otherwise, the places in heap will be different, so it will return false.
In that case, to be able to compare the values, we check a specific method
"num1.equals(num2)".

Note that, arrays are also reference type. So, thus, if we have two
different arrays (even the same values), the " == " operator will return
false, because their address are different. If we want to check their
contents, we will use "Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2)" method.
