1) What is HashTable?

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, similar to a Map in Java. It uses a hashing function to compute an index (called a hash code) into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. The key is mapped to the bucket using the hash code, making lookups fast (typically O(1) time complexity).


2) How Does a Hash Table Work?

-When you insert a key-value pair, the hash function generates a hash code for the key.

-The hash code determines the bucket where the value will be stored.

-When you retrieve a value, the hash code is used to find the correct bucket, and then the key is compared within the bucket to locate the value.

-Collision handling: If two keys produce the same hash code (a collision), hash tables use methods like chaining (linked lists inside the buckets) or open addressing (probing to find the next available slot).

3) equals() and hashcode() methods 

-equals() is used to compare two objects for equality. For objects stored in a hash table (like in a HashMap), it's important that two objects considered equal by equals() also return the same hashCode().

-hashCode() generates an integer that represents the hash code of the object. When you store keys in a HashMap, this hash code determines the bucket where the object will be placed.

A key principle: If a.equals(b), then a.hashCode() must be equal to b.hashCode().


4) HashMap

A HashMap<K, V> in Java is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the Map interface. It stores data as key-value pairs.


Features of HashMap:

-Unordered: The elements are not stored in any particular order.

-Allows null values: One null key and multiple null values can be stored.

-Fast lookup: Provides O(1) average time complexity for get() and put() operations.


5) Initial Capacity and Load Factor

-Initial Capacity: This is the number of buckets created when the HashMap is instantiated. The default initial capacity is 16.

-Load Factor: The load factor is a measure of how full the HashMap can get before it needs to increase its capacity (rehashing). The default load factor is 0.75, meaning when the HashMap reaches 75% of its capacity, it will resize (usually doubling its size).

-Rehashing: When the capacity is exceeded due to more elements being added, the HashMap will rehash all entries and redistribute them across a larger number of buckets.


6) Immutable Keys and How to Lose Values in a Map

Immutable Keys: It’s a best practice to use immutable objects (like String, Integer) as keys in a HashMap. This is because the hashCode() of a key must not change while it’s inside the map. If the key's hash code changes (as can happen with mutable objects like custom classes), you might lose access to the associated value.

Losing Values: You lose access to a value if you modify a key after it has been inserted into the map, as the key's hash code will no longer match its original hash bucket.


8) Sort a map by keys

You can use a TreeMap to automatically sort a map by keys.


9) Sort a map by values

Sorting by values is trickier because HashMap doesn't have a built-in method for value sorting. You can use a List of Map. Entry and sort that by values.


--------------------------------------------------


How to traverse HashMap and HashTable?

-The entrySet() method returns a set of Map.Entry<K, V>, where each entry represents a key-value pair. This is often the most efficient way to traverse a map.

-If you only need to iterate over the keys, you can use the keySet() method. You can then use each key to get the corresponding value using map.get(key).

-If you are only interested in the values stored in the map, you can use the values() method, which returns a collection of all the values in the map.
