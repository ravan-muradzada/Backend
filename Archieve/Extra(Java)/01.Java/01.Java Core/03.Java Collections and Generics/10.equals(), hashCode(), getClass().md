1. equals()

Purpose: The equals() method is used to compare two objects for equality. By default, the equals() method in the Object class checks if two references point to the same object in memory (i.e., identity comparison).

Override: To compare the contents of two objects, you should override this method in your class. The general contract for equals() is:


=======================================================

class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true; // Check for reference equality
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false; // Type check
        Person other = (Person) obj; // Cast to Person
        return age == other.age && name.equals(other.name); // Content comparison
    }
}

=======================================================


2. hashCode()

Purpose: The hashCode() method returns an integer hash code value for the object. This is important for objects that will be used as keys in hash-based collections like HashMap, HashSet, etc.

Contract: If two objects are considered equal according to the equals() method, they must have the same hash code. However, the reverse is not necessarily true; different objects can have the same hash code (hash collisions).


=======================================================

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name, age); // Generates a hash code based on name and age
}

=======================================================


3. getClass()

Purpose: The getClass() method returns the runtime class of an object. This is useful for reflection, where you might want to inspect the type of an object at runtime.

Return Type: It returns an instance of Class<?>, which represents the class of the object.


4. toString()

Purpose: The toString() method returns a string representation of the object. By default, it returns a string that consists of the class name followed by the "@" character and the object's hash code in hexadecimal. However, it's a good practice to override this method to provide a meaningful string representation of the object.
