In SQL, there are different categories of operations that can be classified based on their functionality. These are typically divided into DDL, DML, and DQL (or DRL). Here's a breakdown:



1. DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL deals with the structure (schema) of the database. These commands are used to define and manage database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas.

Some keywords in DDL: 
CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE.



2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML is used to manage and manipulate data within tables. It allows users to perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

Some keywords in DDL: 
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.



3. DQL (Data Query Language) / DRL (Data Retrieval Language)

DQL (or DRL) is a subset of SQL that deals with querying and retrieving data. Technically, DQL is a part of DML, but it's often treated separately because it's focused on retrieval operations.
